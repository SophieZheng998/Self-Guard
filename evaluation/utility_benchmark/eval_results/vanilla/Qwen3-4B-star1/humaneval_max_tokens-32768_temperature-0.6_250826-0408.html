That should work.

Testing the first example: &#39;aBCdEf&#39;

Check indices 0,2,4:

s[0] is &#39;a&#39; not in vowels.

s[2] is &#39;C&#39; not in vowels.

s[4] is &#39;E&#39; which is in vowels → count becomes 1. So returns 1. Correct.

Yes, that&#39;s right.

Another test case: &#39;dBBE&#39; → indices 0 and 2.

s[0] is &#39;d&#39; not in vowels. s[2] is &#39;B&#39; not in vowels. Returns 0. Correct.

Another case: &#39;AEIOU&#39; → even indices are 0, 2,4,6. All uppercase vowels. So count is 3? Wait, length is 5, so indices up to 4. So for &#39;ABCDE&#39;, indices 0,2,4. If the string is &#39;AEIOU&#39;, length 5, indices 0-4. Even indices 0,2,4. Each character is A,E,I,U → all vowels. So count would be 3. Which would be correct.

Thus, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.
&lt;/think&gt;

def count_upper(s):
    count = 0

Once i is found, the part before is s[:i], reverse it, and add to s.

Thus, the code would look something like:

s = input string
for i in range(len(s)+1):
    if is_palindrome(s[i:]) :
        return s + s[:i][::-1]

Wait, but why do we go up to len(s)? Because for i ranging from 0 to len(s). If i is 0, then the entire string is checked as a suffix. If none is found, then the entire string is processed as non-palindrome.

But according to the problem statement, the function must create the shortest possible palindrome. Therefore, we want the longest possible palindromic suffix. Hence, the loop starts from i=0 (checking the entire string) down to i=len(s), but perhaps more accurately, looping from i=0 to len(s) and taking the first occurrence where s[i:] is a palindrome. Wait, no—if we loop from i=0 upwards, then the first i where s[i:] is a palindrome may not be the longest. Wait, no. Suppose the entire string is a palindrome. Then i=0 would work, which is the longest possible suffix. Otherwise, we need to find the longest possible suffix. So perhaps we should loop from i=0 to len(s), but in order to find the earliest position where the suffix is a palindrome, or wait, perhaps we should check from the largest possible suffix downwards.

Actually, the correct approach is to find the largest possible k such that the substring s[-k:] is a palindrome. To find that, we can iterate from k= len(s) downto 1, check if s[-k:] is a palindrome. Once found, use that k.

But how does that translate into code?

Alternative approach:

Start from the entire string and check if it&#39;s a palindrome. If yes, return the same string.

If not, check the substring without the last character. Repeat until we find the longest possible palindromic suffix.

This seems similar to the method used in some algorithms.

In Python terms, for example, for the string &#39;abc&#39;, we check if &#39;abc&#39; is a palindrome (no), then check &#39;ab&#39; (no), then &#39;a&#39; (yes). So the longest suffix is &#39;a&#39;.

Then, the rest of the string is &#39;bc&#39;, reversed is &#39;cb&#39;, concatenated to &#39;a&#39; gives &#39;acb&#39;, but wait that&#39;s not right. Wait, no. The original string is &#39;abc&#39;; the longest palindromic suffix is &#39;a&#39;, so we take the prefix before that (which is &#39;bc&#39;), reverse it (&#39;cb&#39;) and add to the original string. So the new string is &#39;abc&#39; + &#39;cb&#39; → &#39;abccb&#39;? Hmm, but that doesn&#39;t seem right. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to take the prefix before the palindromic suffix, reverse it, and prepend it to the original string.

Wait, the idea is that once we find the longest palindromic suffix, say s[k:], then the part before is s[0:k]. We reverse that part and add it to the beginning. So the final string is reversed_part + original_string.

Wait, no. Wait, suppose our original string is s. We find that the longest palindromic suffix is s[k:]. Then, the part before is s[0:k], which is the prefix. Reversing this prefix and appending to the original string would give us the minimal palindrome.

Wait, no. Let me see. Take the example of &#39;cat&#39;:

Original string is &#39;cat&#39;. Longest palindromic suffix is &#39;t&#39; (position k=2?), so s[0:k] is &#39;ca&#39;. Reverse is &#39;ac&#39;, then the resulting string is &#39;ac&#39; + &#39;cat&#39; → &#39;acat&#39;? But that&#39;s not correct. Oh wait, no! Actually, the correct way is to take the prefix up to k, reverse it, and then add it to the original string. Wait, but the original string is already followed by the palindromic suffix. So the correct way is to take the prefix before the palindromic suffix, reverse it, and prepend it to the original string.

No, that&#39;s not right either. Maybe the correct step is to take the prefix before the palindromic suffix, reverse it, and append it to the original string. Wait, for example:

Take &#39;cat&#39; again. The palindromic suffix is &#39;t&#39;, which is at index 2. The prefix before is &#39;ca&#39;. Reverse it to &#39;ac&#39;, and append to the original string: &#39;cat&#39; + &#39;ac&#39; → &#39;catac&#39; which is correct.

Yes. So the formula is: new_str = original_string + reversed_prefix.

Where reversed_prefix is the reverse of the prefix before the palindromic suffix.

So the algorithm is:

Find the longest palindromic suffix in the original string. Let its starting index be k (so the suffix is s[k:]).

Then, the prefix is s[0:k].

Reverse this prefix and append to the original string.

So the code would be:

original = string

find the largest k such that s[k:] is a palindrome.

return original + s[:k][::-1]

Now, how to compute this k?

We can loop from k=0 to len(s):

for k in range(0, len(s)):

   if is_palindrome(s[k:]):

      break

then, the value of k is the smallest such that the suffix is a palindrome. But wait, we need the largest possible k. Wait, no. Wait, for example, if the entire string is a palindrome, then k=0. So the suffix is s[0:], which is the entire string. Thus, the code would pick the largest possible k, meaning the longest possible suffix.

Wait, but how to find the maximal k. Since the larger k is, the shorter the suffix. Wait, no. When k increases, the suffix gets smaller. For instance, k=0 means the entire string; k=1 means the string minus the first character, etc. So if I&#39;m looking for the longest possible suffix that is a palindrome, then I want the largest possible k where s[k:] is a palindrome. Wait, no. Because the larger k is, the smaller the suffix. So to find the largest possible suffix, we need the smallest possible k. Wait, that&#39;s confusing.

Maybe I should think differently. For example, in the case of &#39;cat&#39;, the longest possible suffix that&#39;s a palindrome is &#39;t&#39;, which occurs at k=2. So the code would need to find the minimal k such that s[k:] is a palindrome. Wait, no. How to determine that.

An alternative approach is to loop from k=0 to len(s), and check whether the suffix s[k:] is a palindrome. The first k for which this condition holds is the minimal k, but we want the largest possible k. Wait, no. Because the longer the suffix, the lower the k. So if the entire string is a palindrome, then k=0 is the best option. Else, check for k=1, etc., but that might not be efficient.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to check for the largest possible k such that s[k:] is a palindrome. Which would mean that k is as small as possible. So the strategy is to check from k=0 upward, and stop at the first k where s[k:] is a palindrome. This way, we find the longest possible suffix.

Because, for example, if the entire string is a palindrome, then k=0 is chosen, which is the longest possible suffix.

Otherwise, if not, proceed to check k=1, etc.

So, the code would be:

for k in range(len(s) + 1):

   if is_palindrome(s[k:]):

       return s + s[:k][::-1]

Wait, but when k ranges from 0 to len(s), inclusive. For example, for k = len(s), s[k:] is empty string, which is a palindrome. So this loop would always find a solution.

But we want to find the largest possible k such that s[k:] is a palindrome. Wait, no. We want the smallest k, because that corresponds to the longest possible suffix. Because the longer the suffix, the less k is.

So, for example, in the &#39;cat&#39; example, the loop checks k=0 (entire string): not a palindrome. Then k=1, s[1:] is &#39;at&#39;: not a palindrome. Then k=2, s[2:] is &#39;t&#39;: yes. So the code takes k=2, which is the minimal k where the suffix is a palindrome. Then, the code appends the reversed prefix (up to k).

So the code loops from k=0 to len(s), finds the first k where s[k:] is a palindrome. Then uses that k.

Thus, the code for make_palindrome would be:

def make_palindrome(string: str) -&gt; str:
    # find the longest possible suffix that is a palindrome
    n = len(string)
    for k in range(n+1):
        if is_palindrome(string[k:]):
            return string + string[:k][::-1]
    return &#39;&#39;

Wait, but why include k=n+1? Well, for k =n, the slice is string[n:], which is &#39;&#39;. And &#39;&#39; is a palindrome. So in any case, the loop will find at least that k=n. So the code works.

Testing the examples:

Test case 1: make_palindrome(&#39;&#39;)

Loop runs for k from 0 to 0 (since len(&#39;&#39;) is zero). At k=0, string[k:] is &#39;&#39;, which is a palindrome. Return &#39;&#39; + &#39;&#39;[::-1] → &#39;&#39;. Correct.

Test case 2: &#39;cat&#39;

loop k=0: &#39;cat&#39; is not a palindrome. k=1: &#39;at&#39; no. k=2: &#39;t&#39; yes. So returns &#39;cat&#39; + &#39;ca&#39;[::-1] → &#39;cat&#39;+&#39;ac&#39;=&#39;catac&#39;. Correct.

Third test case: &#39;cata&#39; → expected &#39;catac&#39;.

Checking the loop:

At k=0: &#39;cata&#39; is not a palindrome. k=1: &#39;ata&#39; is a palindrome. So returns &#39;cata&#39; + &#39;c&#39; [reversed of &#39;c&#39;] → &#39;cata&#39;+ &#39;c&#39; → &#39;catac&#39;. Which matches the sample.

Another example: &#39;aab&#39; → the longest suffix that&#39;s a palindrome is &#39;b&#39; (when k=2). So the code adds &#39;aa&#39; reversed → &#39;aaaab&#39;? Wait, no. Original string is &#39;aab&#39;. After processing, the code would take k=2, string[:k] is &#39;aa&#39;, reversed is &#39;aa&#39;, so the new string is &#39;aab&#39; + &#39;aa&#39; → &#39;aabaa&#39;, which is a palindrome. Yes, that&#39;s correct.

What about &#39;abcdcba&#39;? It&#39;s already a palindrome. So the code would return the same string.

So the code seems to handle these cases correctly.

But what about strings where multiple possibilities exist? Like &#39;abba&#39;, the entire string is a palindrome. So the code returns &#39;abba&#39; + nothing → &#39;abba&#39;.

So the code looks solid.

Now, implementing this in Python.

The helper function is_palindrome is already defined, so we can use that.

Putting it together:

def make_palindrome(string: str) -&gt; str:
    &#34;&#34;&#34; Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.&#34;&#34;&#34;
    def is_palindrome(s):
        return s == s[::-1]
    
    n = len(string)
    for k in range(n+1):
        if is_palindrome(string[k:]):
            return string + string[:k][::-1]
    return &#39;&#39;

Wait, but the initial code has the is_palindrome function as a separate helper. In the user&#39;s code, the is_palindrome is defined outside. So in their code, the make_palindrome function can call that helper.

But in the current context, the user wants the make_palindrome function implemented, using the is_palindrome function provided.

So the code would be:

def make_palindrome(string: str) -&gt; str:
    &#34;&#34;&#34; Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.&#34;&#34;&#34;
    n = len(string)
    for k in range(n+1):
        if string[k:] == string[k:][::-1]:
            return string + string[:k][::-1]
    return &#39;&#39;

Wait, but the original code defines the is_palindrome function inside the make_palindrome function? Or is it supposed to reuse the helper function? According to the user&#39;s instructions, the code should read the provided functions and implement accordingly.

Looking back, the user provides:

They have a function is_palindrome defined, which is called within the make_palindrome function.

But in the code provided, the make_palindrome function is supposed to use that helper.

However, in the current setup, the code written above includes the is_palindrome function as a nested function. But perhaps, instead, the code should just call the existing is_palindrome function.

So modifying the code:

def make_palindrome(string: str) -&gt; str:
    n = len(string)
    for k in range(n+1):
        if is_palindrome(string[k:]):
            return string + string[:k][::-1]
    return &#39;&#39;

But then, the is_palindrome function is available in scope.

Assuming that the is_palindrome function is properly imported or exists elsewhere.

But according to the user&#39;s provided code, the is_palindrome function is present. So the code can directly reference it.

Hence, the implementation is correct.

I think this covers all cases. Now, write the code accordingly.
&lt;/think&gt;

def make_palindrome(string: str) -&gt; str:
    &#34;&#34;&#34; Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.&#34;&#34;&#34;
    n = len(string)
    for k in range(n+1):
        if is_palindrome(string[k:]):
            return string + string[:k][::-1]
    return &#39;&#39;</pre>

def tri(n):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
    the last couple centuries. However, what people don&#39;t know is Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Examples:
    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]

    returns True if the date is valid otherwise False.
    The date is valid if all of the following rules are satisfied:
    1. The date string is not empty.
    2. The number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 31 days for months 1,3,5,7,8,10,12. And the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 30 days for months 4,6,9,11. And, the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 29 for the month 2.
    3. The months should not be less than 1 or higher than 12.
    4. The date should be in the format: mm-dd-yyyy

def minPath(grid, k):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N &gt;= 2) and a positive integer k, 
    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
    cell.
    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
    necessarily distinct).
    You CANNOT go off the grid.
    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
    through (let&#39;s call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
    than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 &lt;= i &lt;= k)
    such that lst_A[i] &lt; lst_B[i] and for any j (1 &lt;= j &lt; i) we have
    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
    Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

    Examples:

        Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
        Output: [1, 2, 1]

        Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1

    return is_palindrome and (total_sum &lt;= w)

Wait, let me test against the examples.

Example 1: will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) → False

q is [1,2], reversed is [2,1], not equal. So is_palindrome is false. So overall returns false. Correct.

Second example: [3,2,3] reversed is same as original. Sum is 8. w=1 → 8&gt;1 → returns false. Which matches the sample.

Third example: same list, w=9 → 8&lt;=9 → returns true. Correct.

Fourth example: [3], sum is 3 ≤5 → returns true. Correct.

What about if sum equals w?

Like [3], w=3 → returns true.

Yes.

What about an empty list? Suppose q is [], sum is zero. So if w &gt;=0, then it&#39;s true. But according to the problem statement, maybe the function expects that. However, according to the examples, the function seems to handle any valid input.

But according to the problem description, there&#39;s no mention of handling invalid inputs, so we don&#39;t have to worry about that.

Thus, the code seems correct.
&lt;/think&gt;

def will_it_fly(q, w):
    &#39;&#39;&#39;Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
    The object q will fly if it&#39;s balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.&#39;&#39;&#39;
    return q == q[::-1] and sum(q) &lt;= w</pre>

        For N = 150, the sum of digits will be 6 the output should be &#34;110&#34;.

Wait, but what if N is zero? Let&#39;s see:

If N is 0, then str(N) is &#39;0&#39;, sum is 0. bin(0) is &#39;0b0&#39;, so [2:] is &#39;0&#39; → correct.

Yes.

That&#39;s simple enough. Are there any possible issues?

Well, the constraints mention that N can be 0. So our code handles that.

I think this should work for all cases within the constraints.

Thus, the final code is as above.
&lt;/think&gt;

def even_odd_count(num):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;Given an integer. return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.

     Example:
        even_odd_count(-12) ==&gt; (1, 1)
        even_odd_count(123) ==&gt; (1, 2)

    <pre>    digit = int(digit_char)
    if digit % 2 == 0:
        even_count +=1
    else:
        odd_count +=1

Finally, return (even_count, odd_count)

Let me test some examples.

Example 1: even_odd_count(-12). Absolute value is 12 → digits 1 and 2. 1 is odd, 2 is even. So output (1,1), which matches the sample.

Another example: 123 becomes abs(123)=123. Digits 1 (odd), 2 (even), 3 (odd). So even count 1, odd count 2 → (1,2). Which also matches.

What about edge cases?

Case where num is 0 → returns (1,0).

If num is 5 → (0,1).

Negative numbers like -99 → same as 99 → digits 9 and 9, both odd → (0,2).

I think this logic covers all scenarios.

So putting it all together:

The function will take num, compute absolute value, convert to string, loop through each character, check parity, increment counts, and return the tuple.

Now, coding this in Python.

Wait, but what about when num is 0? Let&#39;s see. str(abs(0)) is &#39;0&#39; → processed once. Correct.

So the code would look like:

def even_odd_count(num):
    even = 0
    odd = 0
    num_abs = abs(num)
    for ch in str(num_abs):
        d = int(ch)
        if d % 2 == 0:
            even +=1
        else:
            odd +=1
    return (even, odd)

Yes, that seems correct.

Testing another case: num=2468 → all even → (4,0). Num=-2468 → same as 2468 → same result.

Looks good.
&lt;/think&gt;

def even_odd_count(num):
    even = 0
    odd = 0
    num_abs = abs(num)
    for ch in str(num_abs):
        d = int(ch)
        if d % 2 == 0:
            even += 1
        else:
            odd += 1
    return (even, odd)</pre>

Wait, let&#39;s test this logic with the sample inputs.

For n=0: range(0+1) is range(1), which is [0]. Joining with space gives &#39;0&#39;, which matches the first example.

For n=5: range(6) gives 0-5, joined as &#39;0 1 2 3 4 5&#39; which matches the second example.

That seems correct. But what about edge cases?

What if n is negative? Well, according to the problem statement, the function is supposed to handle n as per the examples, but maybe the input constraints aren&#39;t specified here. However, looking back at the docstring, there&#39;s no mention of handling invalid inputs, so perhaps we assume that n is non-negative. The examples show n=0 and 5, both valid.

Therefore, the code should work as intended. So the implementation is straightforward using the range and joining.
&lt;/think&gt;

Wait, but wait. What if n is zero? Well, per the problem description, n is a positive integer, so n &gt;=1. So the code works.

This seems simple enough. Let me verify against the examples given.

Sample Input: 3

Output: [3,5,7] → Correct.

Another example: suppose n=2. Output is [2,4]. Which is correct.

What about n=1? It returns [1], which is correct.

So the code seems to handle all cases correctly.

Hence, the implementation is as above.

            total += num
    return total

Wait, what about empty list? But according to the docstring, the input is a non-empty list, so we don&#39;t have to handle that case.

Testing another example. Suppose lst is [1, 3, 5], then indexes 0,1,2. Only index 1 is odd. Value is 3, which is not even. Sum is 0.

Another example: [2, 4, 6, 8]. Indices 0:2 (no), 1:4 (yes, add 4), 2:6 (no), 3:8 (yes, add 8). Total is 12.

Yes, that works.

I think this should work correctly.
&lt;/think&gt;

def hex_key(num):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;You have been tasked to write a function that receives 
    a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal 
    digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number 
    greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).
    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...
    So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, 
    B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).
    Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, 
    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.
    Examples:
    For num = &#34;AB&#34; the output should be 1.
    For num = &#34;1077E&#34; the output should be 2.
    For num = &#34;ABED1A33&#34; the output should be 4.
    For num = &#34;123456789ABCDEF0&#34; the output should be 6.

    Write a function that takes a message, and encodes in such a

    <pre>        # replace with shifted letter
        
        # determine the original character&#39;s case (before swapping?) no, after swapping, the case is known
    
        # generate the shifted letter
    
        # current_letter = swapped_char.lower()
        # index = ord(current_letter) - ord(&#39;a&#39;)
        # shifted_index = index + 2
        # shifted_letter = chr(ord(&#39;a&#39;) + shifted_index)
        
        # then, assign the case of the swapped_char to the shifted_letter
    
        # but wait, the case of the swapped_char determines the case of the shifted_letter
    
        # So, for example, if swapped_char is &#39;E&#39;, then the shifted_letter should be &#39;G&#39; (capitalized)
        # So, we can create the shifted_letter in lowercase, then capitalize it based on the original swapped_char&#39;s case.
        
        # So, create the lowercase version of the shifted letter, then use the same case as the swapped_char.
        
        # Let&#39;s see:
        current_lower = swapped_char.lower()
        idx = ord(current_lower) - ord(&#39;a&#39;)
        shifted_idx = idx + 2
        shifted_char_low = chr(ord(&#39;a&#39;) + shifted_idx)
        # then, make it match the case of swapped_char
        if swapped_char.isupper():
            shifted_char = shifted_char_low.upper()
        else:
            shifted_char = shifted_char_low
            
        # then, replace the swapped_char with shifted_char
        new_char = shifted_char
    else:
        new_char = swapped_char
    
    append new_char to the result.

Putting this together, the code would loop through each character, process as above.

Testing this with the sample &#39;test&#39;:

message is &#39;test&#39;

each character processed:

t -&gt; swapped case is T (uppercase). Not a vowel. So remain T.

e -&gt; swapped case is E. Is vowel? yes. So shift E by 2: E is 5th letter, 5+2=7 → G. So shifted_char_low is &#39;g&#39;. Since swapped_char is uppercase, we make it &#39;G&#39;. So new_char is G.

s -&gt; swapped case is S. Not a vowel. Remain S.

t -&gt; swapped case is T. Not a vowel. Remain T.

Result is T G S T → TGST. Correct.

Second sample: &#39;This is a message&#39; → &#39;tHKS KS C MGSSCGG&#39;

Processing the first few letters:

&#39;This&#39; → T becomes t, h becomes H, i becomes I, s becomes S.

Processing each:

T → swapped case is t. Not vowel. Keep t.

h → swapped is H. Not vowel. Keep H.

i → swapped is I. vowel. Shift I by 2 → k (I is 8th, 8+2=10 → J? Wait wait, hold on. Wait, I is the 9th letter. Let me double-check.

Letters: a(1), b(2), ..., i is 9th. So I is 9. Add 2 → 11, which is K. So the shifted letter is K. So the new character is K. So the third character becomes K.

Fourth character is s → swapped is S. Not vowel. Kept.

So the first four letters are t H K S → tHKS. Which matches the sample.

Another example from the sample: the word &#39;message&#39; → in the sample output, it&#39;s transformed into &#39;MGSSCGG&#39;.

Let me check. The original message is &#39;message&#39; → split into individual letters:

m e s s a g e

Each character is processed:

m → swapped is M. Not vowel. Remains M.

e → swapped is E. vowel. Shift E → G. So new is G.

s → swapped S. Not vowel. Same.

s → swapped S. Not vowel. Same.

a → swapped A. vowel. Shift A → C. New is C.

g → swapped G. vowel? No. Wait, g is not a vowel. So stays G.

e → swapped E. vowel. Shift to G.

So putting these together: M G S S C G G → MSGSCGG? Wait but the sample output says &#39;MGSSCGG&#39;.

Hmm, perhaps my analysis is missing something. Let me look at the entire sample input:

Sample input: &#39;This is a message&#39; → output &#39;tHKS KS C MGSSCGG&#39;.

The last part is &#39;message&#39; becoming &#39;MGSSCGG&#39;.

Let me process &#39;message&#39;:

Original letters: m e s s a g e

After swapping case: M E S S A G E

Process each:

M → not vowel → M.

E → vowel → E +2 → G.

S → not vowel → S.

S → not vowel → S.

A → vowel → A+2=C.

G → not vowel → G.

E → vowel → E+2=G.

So combining these: M G S S C G G → MG SSCGG. But the sample output for this part is &#39;MGSSCGG&#39;. Wait why?

Ah, perhaps there&#39;s a typo in my thinking. Let me count again.

Original letters: m e s s a g e → after swapping case, they become M E S S A G E.

So the sequence after processing:

M → M.

E → G.

S → S.

S → S.

A → C.

G → G.

E → G.

So combined: M G S S C G G → &#39;MGSS CGG&#39;? But the sample output for the full input is &#39;MGSSCGG&#39;.

Ah, perhaps the original &#39;message&#39; is processed as &#39;MGSSCGG&#39;?

Wait, the original &#39;message&#39; is &#39;m e s s a g e&#39;.

After processing, the letters are:

M, G, S, S, C, G, G → concatenated as MGSSCGG. Which matches the sample&#39;s output.

So yes, the code seems to work.

So the code steps are clear.

Now, coding this in Python.

Implementing:

def encode(message):

    vowels = {&#39;a&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;u&#39;}

    res = []

    for c in message:

        swapped_c = c.swapcase()

        if swapped_c.lower() in vowels:

            # compute shifted character

            current_lower = swapped_c.lower()

            idx = ord(current_lower) - ord(&#39;a&#39;)

            shifted_idx = idx + 2

            shifted_char_low = chr(ord(&#39;a&#39;) + shifted_idx)

            if swapped_c.isupper():

                shifted_char = shifted_char_low.upper()

            else:

                shifted_char = shifted_char_low

            res.append(shifted_char)

        else:

            res.append(swapped_c)

    return &#39;&#39;.join(res)

Testing this with the samples:

Test 1: encode(&#39;test&#39;) returns &#39;TGST&#39; ?

Wait let&#39;s run through:

Original message is &#39;test&#39; → &#39;t&#39;,&#39;e&#39;,&#39;s&#39;,&#39;t&#39;.

Each character:

t → swapped is T. Not vowel. Added as T.

e → swapped is E. vowel. Processed. current_lower is &#39;e&#39; → idx 4 → 6 → f? Wait no, wait e is 5th letter. Wait:

ord(&#39;e&#39;) - ord(&#39;a&#39;) is 4. Because &#39;a&#39;=97, &#39;e&#39;=101. 101-97=4. So adding 2 gives 6. So shifted_char_low is &#39;f&#39;. So the shifted character is F (since swapped_c is uppercase E → converted to uppercase F?)

Wait no, the swapped_c is E. So when processing, the code checks if it&#39;s a vowel. It is. Then, current_lower is &#39;e&#39; → idx 4. shifted_idx is 6. shifted_char_low is &#39;g&#39; (because 97 + 6 = 103 → &#39;g&#39;). Oh right, I made a mistake earlier.

Because e is 5th letter. So 5 +2 =7 → g. Ah okay. So code is correct.

So in the first example, the &#39;e&#39; is turned into &#39;g&#39;. So the result is T GST → TGS T → TGST. Correct.

So code works for that.

Another test case: encode(&#39;This is a message&#39;) → expected output is &#39;tHKS KS C MGSSCGG&#39;.

Let me simulate the code.

Take the first &#39;T&#39; in &#39;This&#39;: swapped to &#39;t&#39;, added as is.

&#39;h&#39; → swapped to &#39;H&#39;, not vowel. added as H.

&#39;i&#39; → swapped to &#39;I&#39;, vowel. process. current_lower is &#39;i&#39; → idx 8 → 8+2=10 → j? Wait, &#39;i&#39; is the 9th letter (a=1, ... i=9). So 9 + 2 = 11 → k. So shifted_char_low is &#39;k&#39;, and since swapped_c is uppercase, we uppercase it to &#39;K&#39;. So the third character is K.

&#39;s&#39; → swapped to &#39;S&#39;, not vowel. added as S.

So first four letters are &#39;tHK S&#39; → &#39;tHKS&#39;.

Then space is kept as is. Next comes &#39;i&#39; → swapped to &#39;I&#39; → processed to &#39;K&#39;, etc. So overall, the code produces the sample outputs.

Thus, the code should work.

Potential edge cases: vowels at the beginning/end, uppercase/lowercase mixtures.

What about if the original character is a vowel but after swapping case it becomes non-vowel? Like &#39;E&#39; becomes &#39;e&#39; → which is still a vowel. So the code handles that.

Also, if the original character is lowercase and after swapping is uppercase, but it is a vowel, it gets processed properly.

Another example: &#39;apple&#39; → after swapping case: &#39;APPLE&#39;. Each P, L, P, L, E.

P is not vowel. L is not. P is not. L is not. E is vowel. Shifting E to G. So result is &#39;APPLG&#39;.

But the original message is &#39;apple&#39;, so the code processes it as follows:

Original letters: a p p l e.

After swapping case: A P P L E → each character.

A is vowel → shifted to C. So first character becomes C.

p is not vowel → P.

p → P.

l → L.

e → G.

so the result is C P P L G → CPP LG → &#39;CPP LG&#39;? Wait, but the code would produce &#39;CPLL G&#39;? Or wait, the original message is &#39;apple&#39; → after encoding, the code would process each character:

Original &#39;a&#39; → swapped to &#39;A&#39; → vowel. Shifted to C. So first character is C.

Original &#39;p&#39; → swapped to &#39;P&#39; → not vowel. Stays P.

Same for rest except last &#39;e&#39; → swapped to &#39;E&#39; → shifted to G. So result is C P P L G → &#39;CPP LG&#39; → &#39;CPPLG&#39;.

But the code appends each character, so the total is &#39;CPPLG&#39;.

So the code seems to handle that.

Thus, the code should be correct.
&lt;/think&gt;

def car_race_collision(n: int):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Imagine a road that&#39;s a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that&#39;s moving left to right hits a car that&#39;s moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.

def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.
    The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The
    strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase
    letters in the extension&#39;s name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters 
    in the extension&#39;s name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. 
    You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this 
    format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.
    If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should
    choose the one that comes first in the list.
    For example, if you are given &#34;Slices&#34; as the class and a list of the
    extensions: [&#39;SErviNGSliCes&#39;, &#39;Cheese&#39;, &#39;StuFfed&#39;] then you should

Testing this code.

But wait, what if the file name is &#34;a.b.txt&#34;? Splitting by &#39;.&#39; gives [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;txt&#39;], so len(parts)=3 → returns &#39;No&#39;.

That&#39;s handled properly.

Another case: &#34;a.txt&#34; → works.

What about &#34;a.txt.&#34; ? Split into [&#39;a.txt&#39;, &#39;&#39;] → len is 2, but suffix is &#39;&#39; → returns &#39;No&#39;.

Yes, because suffix is not among the allowed extensions.

Now, another case: &#34;a1.txt&#34; → digits count is 1 → okay.

Another case: &#34;a123.txt&#34; → digits count 3 → okay.

&#34;a1234.txt&#34; → digits 4 → returns &#39;No&#39;.

Yes.

Now, what about the prefix being longer but having leading letters.

All seems covered.

I think this should work.

def get_closest_vowel(word):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;You are given a word. Your task is to find the closest vowel that stands between 
    two consonants from the right side of the word (case sensitive).
    
    Vowels in the beginning and ending doesn&#39;t count. Return empty string if you didn&#39;t
    find any vowel met the above condition. 

    You may assume that the given string contains English letter only.

    get_closest_vowel(&#34;yogurt&#34;) ==&gt; &#34;u&#34;
    get_closest_vowel(&#34;FULL&#34;) ==&gt; &#34;U&#34;

    <div class="content">
    <pre>    vowels = {&#39;a&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;u&#39;}
    # Iterate from the end towards the start, excluding the first and last chars
    for i in range(len(word)-2, 0, -1):
        if word[i].lower() in vowels:
            # Check if prev and next are consonants
            prev_char = word[i-1]
            next_char = word[i+1]
            if prev_char.lower() not in vowels and next_char.lower() not in vowels:
                return word[i]
    return &#34;&#34;

Wait, but why do we check prev_char and next_char for consonants? Because they must be consonants, which means they cannot be vowels.

So, for the current i-th character, the previous character (i-1) and next character (i+1) must be consonants. So, their .lower() is not in vowels.

So, this code should work.

Testing the examples:

Example 1: &#34;yogurt&#34;

Word is &#39;y&#39;,&#39;o&#39;,&#39;g&#39;,&#39;u&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;t&#39;

Length is 6. len(word)-2 is 4. So i runs from 4 downto 1:

i=4: character &#39;r&#39; — not vowel.

i=3: &#39;u&#39; — is vowel. Check prev (i-1)=2: &#39;g&#39; (consonant). next (i+1)=4: &#39;r&#39; (consonant). So return &#39;u&#39;.

Which matches the example.

Second example: &#34;FULL&#34;.

word is [&#39;F&#39;,&#39;U&#39;,&#39;L&#39;,&#39;L&#39;]

len(word) is 4. len-2 is 2. So i ranges from 2 downto 1:

i=2: &#39;L&#39; — not vowel.

i=1: &#39;U&#39; — vowel. Check prev (i-1) is 0: &#39;F&#39; (consonant). next (i+1) is 2: &#39;L&#39; (consonant). So return &#39;U&#39;.

Third example: &#34;quick&#34; → [&#34;q&#34;,&#34;u&#34;,&#34;i&#34;,&#34;c&#34;,&#34;k&#34;]

len(word) is 5. len-2 is 3. i runs from 3 downto 1.

i=3: &#39;c&#39; — not vowel.

i=2: &#39;i&#39; — vowel. Check prev (i-1)=1: &#39;u&#39; is vowel. So invalid. So skip.

i=1: &#39;u&#39; — vowel. prev is q (consonant). next is i (vowel). So next is vowel. So invalid. So return &#34;&#34;.

Fourth example: &#34;ab&#34; → len is 2. len-2 is 0. So loop runs from 0 downto 1, which does not happen. So returns &#34;&#34;, which is correct.

What about a word like &#34;abc&#34;? len is 3. len-2 is 1. So i=1. Character is b. Not vowel. So returns &#34;&#34;. Correct.

Another test case: &#34;apple&#34; → [a,p,p,l,e].

Looking from the right, check positions 3 (l), 2(p), 1(p), 0(a).

Starts at i=3 (l): not vowel.

i=2: p → not vowel.

i=1: p → not vowel.

i=0: a is vowel, but that&#39;s the first character. So not included.

So returns &#34;&#34;.

Another case: &#34;bca&#34; → letters b,c,a. i runs from 1 (since len is 3, len-2 is 1). i=1: c. Not vowel. So returns &#34;&#34;.

Another case: &#34;bcda&#34; → letters b, c, d, a. i runs from 2 downto 1.

At i=2: d. Not vowel.

i=1: c. Not vowel.

so returns &#34;&#34;.

Another case: &#34;bcdE&#34; → assuming the word is &#39;bcdE&#39;, len is 4. i runs from 2 downto 1.

i=2: d → not vowel.

i=1: c → not vowel.

returns &#34;&#34;.

Another case: &#34;bead&#34; → letters b, e, a, d.

Processing from i=2 downto 1.

i=2: a → is vowel. check prev (i-1=1: e, which is vowel. so invalid. thus, skips.

then i=1: e → vowel. check prev (b, consonant), next (a, vowel). So invalid.

thus returns &#34;&#34;.

Another example: &#34;baee&#34; → len 4. i runs from 2 downto 1.

i=2: e. check prev (i-1=1: a, vowel. invalid.

i=1: a. prev is b (consonant), next is e (vowel). invalid.

so returns &#34;&#34;.

Another example: &#34;bedcba&#34; → let&#39;s see.

positions 0:b, 1:e, 2:d, 3:c, 4:b, 5:a.

looking for vowels between consonants.

from the right, i runs from 4 downto 1.

i=4: b → not vowel.

i=3: c → not vowel.

i=2: d → not vowel.

i=1: e → vowel. check prev (i-1=0: b, consonant. next (i+1=2: d, consonant. So return e.

So the code would return &#39;e&#39;.

Yes.

Now, testing the code with the samples:

Sample 1: yogurt → code returns &#39;u&#39;.

Sample 2: FULL → returns &#39;U&#39;.

Sample 3: quick → returns &#39;&#39;.

Sample 4: ab → returns &#39;&#39;.

All pass.

Edge Cases:

Case where there are multiple options. Like &#34;acbd&#34;, where the vowel is &#39;a&#39;? Wait, no. Let&#39;s imagine the word &#34;acbD&#34;. So, the code loops from i=2 downto 1.

i=2: &#39;b&#39; → not vowel.

i=1: &#39;c&#39; → not vowel.

so returns &#39;&#39;. Another case: &#34;aabba&#34;, the vowels are &#39;a&#39;s. Checking from right, the third character is &#39;b&#39;, then &#39;a&#39; (at index 2). So, i=2: &#39;a&#39;. check prev (i-1=1: &#39;a&#39;) which is vowel. So invalid. So returns &#34;&#34;.

Another case: &#34;axxbyz&#34; → let&#39;s see. The vowels are x... no. Wait, the word is axxbyz.

Letters: a x x b y z.

From the right, i starts at len-2 = 5-2=3? Assuming len is 6, indexes 0-5. So i runs from 4 downto 1.

i=4: y → vowel. check prev (i-1=3: b, consonant. next (i+1=5: z, consonant. So return y.

So the code would return &#39;y&#39;.

Yes.

So, the code seems to handle that.

Potential issues:

- What if the word has more than one valid option? For example, &#34;xyzayz&#34;, where the first occurrence from the right is a vowel between consonants. The code picks the first one, which is the closest to the end.

Another edge case: words with exactly two consonants around a vowel. For example, &#34;cbavd&#34;, where the vowel is v. Wait, no, &#39;v&#39; is consonant. Maybe something like &#34;ccave&#34;: letters c, c, a, v, e. From the right, i=3: v (not vowel). i=2: a. check prev is c, next is v. both consonants. So returns &#39;a&#39;.

Yes.

I think this covers most scenarios.

So, the code is written as:

def get_closest_vowel(word):
    vowels = {&#39;a&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;u&#39;}
    for i in range(len(word)-2, 0, -1):
        if word[i].lower() in vowels:
            prev = word[i-1]
            next_ = word[i+1]
            if prev.lower() not in vowels and next_.lower() not in vowels:
                return word[i]
    return &#34;&#34;
&lt;/think&gt;

def get_closest_vowel(word):
    vowels = {&#39;a&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;u&#39;}
    for i in range(len(word)-2, 0, -1):
        if word[i].lower() in vowels:
            prev = word[i-1]
            next_ = word[i+1]
            if prev.lower() not in vowels and next_.lower() not in vowels:
                return word[i]
    return &#34;&#34;</pre>

    We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c
    then check if the result string is palindrome.
    A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
    You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.
    Example
    For s = &#34;abcde&#34;, c = &#34;ae&#34;, the result should be (&#39;bcd&#39;,False)
    For s = &#34;abcdef&#34;, c = &#34;b&#34;  the result should be (&#39;acdef&#39;,False)

    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    
    Example:
    * eat(5, 6, 10) -&gt; [11, 4]
    * eat(4, 8, 9) -&gt; [12, 1]
    * eat(1, 10, 10) -&gt; [11, 0]

    Variables:
    @number : integer
        the number of carrots that you have eaten.
    @need : integer
        the number of carrots that you need to eat.
    @remaining : integer

Wait, but what if the list has only one element? It should return that element. That&#39;s handled correctly.

Testing this code against the samples.

Looks good. Therefore, this should work.

                break
        if valid:
            result.append(num)
    return result

Wait, but the problem says &#34;in ascending order&#34;, but since we loop from start to end, the list will naturally be in order. So appending directly gives the desired order.

Yes.

Testing this code against the samples:

Sample 1: generate_integers(2,8) → numbers from 2 to 8. Each is a single digit even. So [2,4,6,8]. Correct.

Sample 2: generate_integers(8,2) → same as sample 1, returns same list.

Sample3: generate_integers(10,14) → nothing added. Returns empty list. Correct.

Another example: generate_integers(20,28) → 20,22,24,26,28. Are all these numbers valid?

Well, 20: yes. 22: yes. 24: yes. 26: yes. 28: yes. So the code would collect them.

Another edge case: generate_integers(9,9) → returns empty list, because 9 is odd.

What about generate_integers(0,0)? According to the problem statement, a and b are positive integers. So the parameters are guaranteed to be positive. So we don&#39;t need to handle cases with zero.

But the code handles it anyway.

I think this implementation meets all the requirements.
&lt;/think&gt;

def generate_integers(a, b):
    start = min(a, b)
    end = max(a, b)
    result = []
    for num in range(start, end + 1):
        s = str(num)
        valid = True
        for c in s:
            if c not in {&#39;0&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;4&#39;, &#39;6&#39;, &#39;8&#39;}:
                valid = False
                break

def move_one_ball(arr):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;We have an array &#39;arr&#39; of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
    the following operation on the given array:
        You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.
    
    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
    then return True else return False.
    If the given array is empty then return True.

    Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

    For Example:
    
    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==&gt;True
    Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
                 be achieved for the given array.
    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==&gt;False
    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given

    <pre>    def is_prime(n):
        if n &lt; 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    words = sentence.split()
    filtered_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return &#39; &#39;.join(filtered_words)

Yes, that seems correct.

Testing against examples.

Example 1:

Input: &#34;This is a test&#34;

split into [&#39;This&#39;, &#39;is&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;test&#39;]

len: 4, 2, 1, 4.

Which ones are prime? 2 is prime. So the filtered list is [&#39;is&#39;], joined gives &#34;is&#34;.

Which matches the sample.

Second example:

sentence = &#34;lets go for swimming&#34;

words: &#39;lets&#39; (4), &#39;go&#39;(2), &#39;for&#39;(3), &#39;swimming&#39;(8).

Primes are 2 and 3. So words are &#39;go&#39; and &#39;for&#39;. Joined becomes &#39;go for&#39;.

Which matches sample 2.

What about edge cases?

Test case where a word has length 1. Like &#34;hello world a&#34;, then len(a)=1, which is not prime. So output is &#34;&#34; ?

Yes.

Another case: sentence is &#34;prime&#34;, which has length 5, which is prime. So output is &#34;prime&#34;.

Another case: sentence is &#34;a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z&#34;, each letter is a word. Then check each length. Only words with length 2 (like &#39;ab&#39;) would be included. But since each word is a single character, none are primes except length 2, but in this case, each word is length 1. So output is empty string.

So the code handles these scenarios.

I think this should cover everything. Now, coding accordingly.
&lt;/think&gt;

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n &lt; 2:
            return False

    return len({c.lower() for c in string})

Wait, but in Python, using a generator expression inside the set comprehension. Yes.

Testing the sample inputs:

Sample 1: &#39;xyzXYZ&#39;

Each character becomes x, y, z, x, y, z. The set is {x,y,z} → len 3. Correct.

Sample 2: &#39;Jerry&#39; → &#39;jerry&#39; → set is {&#39;j&#39;,&#39;e&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;y&#39;} → len 4. Correct.

Yes, that seems to work.

So the function is straightforward. Now, writing the code accordingly.

I think that&#39;s the correct implementation.

That&#39;s straightforward. Testing this with the sample input should work. Let me verify again. If a is 5 and h is 3, multiplying gives 15, divide by 2 gives 7.5. Correct.

I don&#39;t see any edge cases mentioned here, so assuming that the inputs are valid positive numbers. Since the problem doesn&#39;t mention handling invalid inputs, we don&#39;t need to add error checking.

Therefore, the implementation is simple and direct.

def get_row(lst, x):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists,
    which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,
    each row may contain a different number of columns.
    Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list,
    and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that
    each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.
    Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.
    Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.
    
    Examples:
    get_row([
      [1,2,3,4,5,6],
      [1,2,3,4,1,6],
      [1,2,3,4,5,1]
    ], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
    get_row([], 1) == []
    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]

def anti_shuffle(s):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle(&#39;Hi&#39;) returns &#39;Hi&#39;
    anti_shuffle(&#39;hello&#39;) returns &#39;ehllo&#39;
    anti_shuffle(&#39;Hello World!!!&#39;) returns &#39;Hello !!!Wdlor&#39;

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,
    and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
    Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, 
    and all buckets have the same capacity.
    Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
    Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.

    Example 1:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 1
        Output: 6

    Example 2:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 2
        Output: 5
    
    Example 3:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
            bucket_capacity : 5
        Output: 0

    Constraints:
        * all wells have the same length
        * 1 &lt;= grid.length &lt;= 10^2
        * 1 &lt;= grid[:,1].length &lt;= 10^2
        * grid[i][j] -&gt; 0 | 1

But how to handle other types? Well, assuming that the input list only contains numbers (int or float), otherwise, the code will fail. But according to the problem statement, perhaps we don&#39;t have to worry about that; just focus on the numbers provided.

Once we&#39;ve determined that a number is an integer, we then check if it&#39;s non-negative. Only then do we square it and add to the sum.

So putting this together, the algorithm steps would be:

Initialize total_sum to 0

Loop over each number in the input list:

   Check if the number is an integer (using the method above)

      if yes:

         if the number &gt;= 0:

             add (number)^2 to total_sum

          else:

              ignore

      else:

          ignore

Return total_sum

Now, coding this in Python.

Implementing the check for integer status:

In Python, for a number, we can check if it&#39;s an instance of int. Else, if it&#39;s a float, check if it is integral (e.g., 5.0 is integral).

So inside the loop:

num = current element

if isinstance(num, int):

   proceed

elif isinstance(num, float):

   if num.is_integer():

       proceed

   else:

       skip

else:

   skip

Then, after confirming it&#39;s an integer, check if it&#39;s &gt;=0.

If yes, compute square and add to total.

Now, handling this in code.

So, the code structure would be something like:

def double_the_difference(lst):
    total = 0
    for num in lst:
        if isinstance(num, int):
            if num &gt;=0:
                total += num **2
        elif isinstance(num, float):
            if num.is_integer():
                num_int = int(num)
                if num_int &gt;=0:
                    total += num_int**2
        # else, ignore
    return total

Testing against the examples:

Example 1: [1,3,2,0]

Each element is int, non-negative. Sum 1^2+3^2+2^2+0=1+9+4+0=14. Wait wait, but according to the sample, the expected result is 10. Wait, why? Wait the original sample says:

double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10 ?

Wait wait, why? Oh, wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Looking again at the docstring:

&#34;the sum of squares of the numbers in the list that are odd&#34;

Oh right! So the numbers must be odd. Not just non-negative integers. So my mistake earlier was thinking that it&#39;s adding squares of non-negative integers, but actually, it&#39;s adding squares of odd numbers among those.

So the actual logic is:

Check if the number is an integer, non-negative, and odd.

So the previous plan missed that step. That explains why the first example returns 10 instead of 14.

So now, correcting the approach:

After determining that the number is an integer (non-negative), check if it is odd.

Only then add the square.

So modifying the code accordingly.

Thus, the revised steps:

For each num in lst:

check if it&#39;s an integer (as before)

then, if it&#39;s non-negative,

and if it&#39;s odd (num % 2 != 0),

add square to total.

Otherwise, ignore.

So adjusting the code:

Inside the loop:

after checking it&#39;s an integer, and non-negative:

if num % 2 != 0:

   add to total.

Else:

   skip.

So, updating the code.

So, the code becomes:

def double_the_difference(lst):
    total = 0
    for num in lst:
        if isinstance(num, int):
            if num &gt;= 0:
                if num % 2 != 0:
                    total += num * num
        elif isinstance(num, float):
            if num.is_integer():
                num_int = int(num)
                if num_int &gt;= 0:
                    if num_int % 2 != 0:
                        total += num_int * num_int
        # else, ignore
    return total

Testing the first example: [1,3,2,0]

Numbers are 1 (odd), 3 (odd), 2 (even), 0 (even). Their squares added are 1 +9 = 10 → matches the sample.

Another sample: [-1, -2, 0].

All are negative except 0. But 0 is even, so nothing is added. Hence sum is 0.

Third sample [9, -2]: 9 is positive and odd, squared is 81. -2 is negative, ignored. So answer 81.

Fourth sample [0] → 0 is even, so nothing added. Answer 0.

So these tests pass.

What about a float that is an integer, e.g., 5.0?

It would be processed as 5, which is odd. So squared adds 25.

Another case: [5.5] → not integer, so ignored.

[6.0] → checked as integer, is 6, even → no addition.

So the code handles these cases correctly.

Edge Cases:

Empty list → returns 0.

List with all negative numbers → returns 0.

List with non-integers → ignored.

So the code looks solid.

I think this covers all the requirements.
&lt;/think&gt;

def double_the_difference(lst):
    total = 0
    for num in lst:
        if isinstance(num, int):
            if num &gt;= 0:
                if num % 2 != 0:
                    total += num * num
        elif isinstance(num, float):
            if num.is_integer():
                num_int = int(num)
                if num_int &gt;= 0:
                    if num_int % 2 != 0:
                        total += num_int * num_int

def get_odd_collatz(n):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Note: 
        1. Collatz(1) is [1].
        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

    For example:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.

    &#39;&#39;&#39;
    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number
    and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant
    from two integers, round it away from zero.

    Examples
    &gt;&gt;&gt; closest_integer(&#34;10&#34;)
    10
    &gt;&gt;&gt; closest_integer(&#34;15.3&#34;)
    15

    Note:
    Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant
    from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the
    farthest from zero. For example closest_integer(&#34;14.5&#34;) should
    return 15 and closest_integer(&#34;-14.5&#34;) should return -15.

def pluck(arr):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    &#34;Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.
    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.

    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Example 1:
        Input: [4,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

    Example 2:
        Input: [1,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. 

    Example 3:
        Input: []
        Output: []
    
    Example 4:
        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]
        Output: [0, 1]
        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,
                     so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.

    Constraints:
        * 1 &lt;= nodes.length &lt;= 10000
        * 0 &lt;= node.value
