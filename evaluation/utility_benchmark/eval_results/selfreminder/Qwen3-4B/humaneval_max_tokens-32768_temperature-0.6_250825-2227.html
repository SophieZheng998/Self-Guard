        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] in vowels:
            count +=1
    return count

Testing this against examples.

First example: &#39;aBCdEf&#39;

Indices 0: &#39;a&#39; lower, not counted. Index 2: &#39;C&#39; upper but not vowel. Index 4: &#39;E&#39; upper vowel. So count is 1. Correct.

Second example: &#39;abcdefg&#39; all lowercase. No counts. Correct.

Third example: &#39;dBBE&#39; indices 0: d (lower), 2: B (not vowel). So 0. Correct.

Looks like this should work. What about edge cases? Like empty string? Returns 0. String of length 1, like &#39;A&#39;? Then index 0 is even, and it&#39;s uppercase vowel. Returns 1. That&#39;s correct.

Another case: &#39;ABCD&#39;, indices 0:A (counted), 2:C (not vowel). So returns 1. Yes.

I think that&#39;s all. The code seems to handle all cases.

    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd
    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.

    Example 1:

        Input: 3
        Output: (1, 2)
        Explanation:
        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.

    Example 2:

        Input: 12
        Output: (4, 6)
        Explanation:
        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.

    Note:

    </div>
    <div class="content">
    <pre>    s = str(num)
    return s == s[::-1]

Then, loop through 1 to n, check each number, and count.

So putting it all together:

def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    even = 0
    odd = 0
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        if is_palindrome(num):
            if num % 2 == 0:
                even += 1
            else:
                odd += 1
    return (even, odd)

But wait, the helper function is_palindrome is needed. However, in Python, functions inside other functions can be defined, but perhaps it&#39;s better to inline the check to avoid unnecessary overhead. Alternatively, just include the check directly.

Alternatively, replace the helper function with the string reversal check inline.

So modifying the code:

def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    even = 0
    odd = 0
    for num in range(1, n+1):
        s = str(num)
        if s == s[::-1]:
            if num % 2 == 0:
                even += 1
            else:
                odd += 1
    return (even, odd)

That should work.

Testing the first example:

n=3. Loop runs for 1,2,3.

For 1: &#39;1&#39; reversed is &#39;1&#39;, so palindrome. Odd. So odd becomes 1.

For 2: palindrome. Even. even becomes 1.

For 3: palindrome. Odd. odd becomes 2. So return (1,2). Correct.

Second example: n=12. The palindromes are 1-9 (each is a single digit, hence palindrome), and 11. So 10 numbers. Among them, even numbers are 2,4,6,8 (four numbers), and the rest (1,3,5,7,9,11) are six. So output (4,6). Correct.

What about edge cases?

Test case where n=1. Then the only number is 1, which is odd. So output (0,1).

Another test case: n=11. Palindromes are 1-9, 11. Even numbers: 2,4,6,8 (4), and 11 is odd. So output (4,6). Wait, but 11 is also a palindrome. So total even count is 4, odd is 6 (since 1,3,5,7,9,11). Yes.

Another test case: n=2. Palindromes are 1 (odd), 2 (even). Output (1,1).

Yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, the code should handle all cases properly.
&lt;/think&gt;

def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    even = 0
    odd = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        s = str(num)
        if s == s[::-1]:
            if num % 2 == 0:
                even += 1
            else:
                odd += 1
    return (even, odd)</pre>

def tri(n):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
    the last couple centuries. However, what people don&#39;t know is Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Examples:
    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]

        res.append(val)
    return res

Testing this with the example:

For n=3, returns [1,3,2,8] → correct.

Another example: tri(4) returns [1,3,2,8,3], which is correct.

Another example: tri(2) returns [1,3,2], correct.

What about n=5? Let&#39;s compute manually.

k=2: 2 → even → 1 +1=2 → res=[1,3,2]

k=3: odd → 2+3 +1+(4/2) → 5 +2=7? Wait no:

Wait, for k=3, the formula is res[-1] + res[-2] + 1 + (k+1)//2 → res[-1]=2, res[-2]=3 → 2+3=5; 1 + (3+1)/2 = 1+2=3 → total 5+3=8 → correct.

k=4: even → 1 +4/2=3 → res becomes [1,3,2,8,3]

k=5: odd → res[-1]=3, res[-2]=8 → 3+8=11; 1 + (5+1)/2=1+3=4 → total 11+4=15 → append 15. Res is [1,3,2,8,3,15]. So tri(5) is 15.

Yes, this seems correct.

Thus, this code should work.

Wait, but the code above checks for d&gt;31 first, then for specific months. Let me think again.

Original plan:

Check for m in certain groups. Then set max_day accordingly.

Alternative approach:

after getting m and d:

if m is 1,3,5,7,8,10,12 → max_day is 31

elif m is 4,6,9,11 → max_day is 30

else (m=2): max_day is 29

so check if d is between 1 and max_day.

In code:

if m in [1,3,5,7,8,10,12]:

    max_d = 31

elif m in [4,6,9,11]:

    max_d = 30

else:

    max_d = 29

if d &lt;1 or d &gt; max_d:

    return False

But in the current code, the code checks if d &lt;1 or d&gt;31. Which would catch days over 31, but for months that have 30 or 29 days. Hmm, perhaps better to proceed with the conditional approach.

Alternatively, the code written earlier may not work correctly. For example, if m is 4 (April), which has 30 days. Suppose d is 31 → the code checks if d&gt;31 → returns false. But if m is 4, and d is 31, then the code would return false. Correct.

But in the code written earlier, the code first checks if d&gt;31. Then for months 4,6,9,11, checks if d&gt;30. But suppose m is 4 and d is 31 → first check d&gt;31 → true → returns false. Then, for m in [4,6,...], check if d&gt;30 → but since d is already 31, which is greater than 30, but that&#39;s redundant. However, in the code as written, the code checks for d&gt;31 first, then for m in [4, ...], checks d&gt;30. But that&#39;s unnecessary, because if d&gt;31, it&#39;s already caught. So maybe the code can be optimized.

But in the code written initially, the code checks:

if d &lt; 1 or d &gt; 31: return False

then, if m is in [4,6,9,11], check if d&gt;30 → return False.

This is incorrect. Because if m is 4, and d is 31, then the first check (d&gt;31) is true → returns false. But if m is 4 and d is 30, then the first check passes (d&lt;=31), then the next check (m in [4...], d&gt;30 → 30 is not &gt;30 → no action. So code proceeds.

But in reality, for m=4, the maximum day is 30. So if d is 30, it&#39;s acceptable. If d is 31, it&#39;s invalid. So the code first checks for d&gt;31, which catches d=31. Then for m in [4..], checks d&gt;30. But if d is 31, it&#39;s already handled in the first check. So the code is correct.

However, the code as written may have a mistake. Let me walk through an example.

Suppose m=4, d=31 → first check if d&gt;31 → yes → return False. Correct.

Another example: m=4, d=30 → first check is d&gt;31? No. Then check if m in [4...] → yes. Check if d&gt;30 → 30 is not &gt;30 → no. So returns True. Correct.

Another example: m=2, d=29 → first check d&gt;31? No. Then m is not in [4..., so no check. Returns True. Correct.

Another example: m=2, d=30 → first check d&gt;31? No. Then m is not in [4..., so no check. But d=30 is larger than 29 → should return False. Ah, here&#39;s a bug.

Because the code currently checks if d&lt;1 or d&gt;31 → which is not triggered here (d is 30). Then, for m in [4...], no. Then, for m=2, the code does not check if d exceeds 29. Hence, the code would incorrectly return True for m=2 and d=30.

Ah, right. This is a problem. So the code as written is wrong.

So the original code&#39;s logic is flawed. Because the code first checks if d is outside 1-31. Then, for months that have 30 days, checks if d&gt;30. But for m=2, which has 29 days, the code does not check if d&gt;29. Thus, for m=2 and d=30, the code would pass the first check (d is 30 ≤31), then not trigger any further checks, thus returning True, which is wrong.

Thus, the code needs to properly check the day based on the month.

Hence, the correct approach is to determine the maximum day based on the month and compare d to that.

So the code should be structured as follows:

Once m and d are determined, check:

if m is 1,3,5,7,8,10,12 → max_day =31

elif m is 4,6,9,11 → max_day=30

else (m=2) → max_day=29

then check if d is between 1 and max_day inclusive.

So the code should be rewritten to compute max_day based on the month, then check d.

So modifying the code:

...

    if m &lt; 1 or m &gt; 12:
        return False
    if d &lt; 1 or d &gt; 31:
        return False
    if m in [4,6,9,11]:
        if d &gt; 30:
            return False
    elif m == 2:
        if d &gt; 29:
            return False
    return True

Wait, but this still leaves the possibility of d being 31 for months that have 30 or 29 days. For example, if m is 4, d is 31 → first check d&gt;31? No. Then, since m is in [4,6...], check if d&gt;30 → yes → return false. Correct.

Similarly, for m=2, d=30 → first check d&gt;31? No. Then, since m is 2, check if d&gt;29 → yes → return false. Correct.

But why did the code previously have the check for d&gt;31? Maybe that&#39;s redundant now. Because once the month is checked, the code ensures that d is within the appropriate limits.

But wait, the first line after checking m is:

if d &lt;1 or d&gt;31 → return false.

Which would reject any d&gt;31. But for months that have 30 or 29 days, d can be up to 30 or 29, respectively. So for example, for m=4, d=31 would be rejected by this check. But for m=4, d=30 is allowed. But the code would check for d&gt;30 (in the second condition) only if m is in [4,6...]

So the code is now correct.

But why check d&gt;31 first? Because for months that have 31 days, d can be up to 31. For others, d cannot exceed 31. So, for example, for m=4, d=31 is invalid. The first check (d&gt;31) would capture that. But for m=4, d=30 is allowed. The first check passes (d=30 &lt;=31), then the code checks for m in [4,6...], and sees that d&gt;30 → returns false. So that&#39;s correct.

So the revised code would be:

def valid_date(date):
    if not date:
        return False
    parts = date.split(&#39;-&#39;)
    if len(parts) != 3:
        return False
    if len(parts[0]) != 2 or len(parts[1]) != 2 or len(parts[2]) != 4:
        return False
    try:
        m = int(parts[0])
        d = int(parts[1])
        y = int(parts[2])
    except ValueError:
        return False
    if m &lt; 1 or m &gt; 12:
        return False
    if d &lt; 1 or d &gt; 31:
        return False
    if m in [4,6,9,11]:
        if d &gt; 30:
            return False
    elif m == 2:
        if d &gt; 29:
            return False
    return True

This should fix the previous error.

Testing the scenario where m=2 and d=30:

d is 30. First check d&gt;31? No. Then check m in [4,6,9,11]? No. Then check if m==2 → yes. Check if d&gt;29 → yes → return false. Correct.

Another test case: m=4, d=31 → first check d&gt;31 → yes → return false.

Another test case: m=4, d=30 → first check d&gt;31 → no. Then check m in [4,6...], and d&gt;30 → yes → return false. Wait, but d=30 is equal to 30, so the condition is d&gt;30. So for d=30, it would not trigger. So the code would return True? Wait, that&#39;s a problem!

Wait, in the code:

if m in [4,6,9,11]:
    if d &gt; 30:
        return False

So for m=4 and d=30 → d is not &gt;30, so no return False. Then the code proceeds to return True. But that&#39;s incorrect. Because April has 30 days. So d=30 is valid. So the code returns True, which is correct.

Ah, yes. Because the code checks for d&gt;30. So for d=30, it&#39;s not greater than 30 → no action taken. So the code proceeds. So for m=4, d=30 → returns True. Which is correct.

Another example: m=4, d=31 → first check d&gt;31 → yes → return false. Correct.

So the code is fixed now.

Thus, the final code includes all required validations.
&lt;/think&gt;

Wait, but what about when the average is an integer? For example, n=1, m=5 → 3.0, which rounds to 3. So that&#39;s correct.

But wait, what if n and m are such that their sum is even? Like n=1, m=3 → sum 4, average 2.0 → round is 2. Correct.

So this code should handle all cases.

Testing the fourth sample again: n=20, m=33 → sum is 53 → average 26.5. round(26.5) is 26. So bin(26) is &#39;0b11010&#39;, which matches the sample.

Yes, looks good.

            total += num
    return total

Yes, that seems straightforward. Let me test the sample input.

Sample input: arr = [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9], k=4. First four elements are 111,21,3,4000. Check each:

111: abs(111)=111 &gt;=100 → exclude.
21: 21&lt;100 → add 21.
3: 3 &lt;100 → add 3.
4000: 4000 ≥100 → exclude. Total is 21+3=24. Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: if k is 1, and arr[0] is 99 → sum is 99. If arr[0] is 100 → sum is 0.

What about negative numbers? Like arr = [-99, ...], k=1. Then abs(-99) is 99 &lt; 100 → included. So sum is -99.

So the code handles negatives correctly.

I think that&#39;s all. The code should work.

    # Sort the filtered list by length, then alphabetically
    filtered.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x), x))
    return filtered

Wait, but the examples show that in the first example, [&#34;aa&#34;, &#34;a&#34;, &#34;aaa&#34;] becomes [&#34;aa&#34;]. Let&#39;s test this code.

Original list: [&#34;aa&#34;, &#34;a&#34;, &#34;aaa&#34;]

Filtered list: [&#34;aa&#34;] (since &#34;a&#34; has length 1, which is odd, and &#34;aaa&#34; is 3, also odd). Then sorted by length (which is 2) and alphabetically. So the result is [&#34;aa&#34;], which matches the example.

Second example: [&#34;ab&#34;, &#34;a&#34;, &#34;aaa&#34;, &#34;cd&#34;] → filtered is [&#34;ab&#34;, &#34;cd&#34;] (since &#34;a&#34; is length 1, &#34;aaa&#34; is 3). Then sorted by length (both are 2), so sorted alphabetically: &#34;ab&#34; comes before &#34;cd&#34;. So the result is [&#34;ab&#34;, &#34;cd&#34;], which matches the example.

Another test case: suppose the input is [&#34;abc&#34;, &#34;def&#34;, &#34;ghi&#34;], all lengths 3 (odd), so filtered list is empty. Return empty list.

What if input is [&#34;aa&#34;, &#34;bb&#34;, &#34;cc&#34;] → all even length. Sorted by length (all same), so sorted alphabetically: [&#34;aa&#34;, &#34;bb&#34;, &#34;cc&#34;].

Another case: [&#34;ba&#34;, &#34;ab&#34;, &#34;aa&#34;] → all length 2. Sorted alphabetically: [&#34;aa&#34;, &#34;ab&#34;, &#34;ba&#34;].

Yes, that seems correct.

Thus, the code should work. Now, checking the function name: the user&#39;s code is named sorted_list_sum, but the docstring mentions list_sort. Probably a typo in the docstring. But the code should match the function definition given.

So, the implementation is as above.
&lt;/think&gt;

def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,
    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,

    <pre>    return 1
else:
    a, b = 1, 1

        c = a + b

        b = c
    return b

Yes, that should work. Testing for n=8:

Loop runs for 3,4,5,6,7,8 (since range(3,9) is 3-8 inclusive, 6 iterations).

Let me simulate:

Start a=1, b=1.

Iteration 3: c=2, a becomes 1, b becomes 2.

Iteration 4: c=1+2=3, a=2, b=3.

Iteration5: c=2+3=5, a=3, b=5.

Iter6: c=3+5=8, a=5, b=8.

Iter7: c=5+8=13, a=8, b=13.

Iter8: c=8+13=21, a=13, b=21.

Then return b=21. Which matches the sample. So yes.

Another test case: n=10. Let&#39;s see:

After iteration 8, b is 21. Then for 9th iteration:

c=13+21=34, a=21, b=34.

Then 10th iteration: c=21+34=55, a=34, b=55. Return 55. Correct.

So the code seems right.

Now, implementing this in Python. Also, note that the function is supposed to take an integer n and return the nth Fibonacci number as per the examples.

So the code would be:

def fib(n: int):
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    a, b = 1, 1
    for _ in range(3, n + 1):
        c = a + b
        a = b
        b = c
    return b

That&#39;s the implementation. Now check for edge cases. What if n is 0? Well, the function&#39;s examples don&#39;t cover that, but according to the problem description, the function is supposed to return the nth Fibonacci number. However, the given examples start from n=1. The problem says nothing about n=0, but since the function&#39;s parameters specify n as an integer, perhaps it&#39;s expected to handle all integers &gt;=1. But the code as written will raise an error for n=0. However, the tests provided do not include such cases, so perhaps the function is intended to work for positive integers. Since the examples have n=1, 8, 10, the code is correct for those.

Thus, the implemented function meets the requirements.
&lt;/think&gt;

def fib(n: int):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;Return n-th Fibonacci number.
    &gt;&gt;&gt; fib(10)
    55
    &gt;&gt;&gt; fib(1)
    1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; fib(8)
    21
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    a, b = 1, 1
    for _ in range(3, n + 1):
        c = a + b
        a = b
        b = c
    return b</pre>

def minPath(grid, k):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N &gt;= 2) and a positive integer k, 
    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
    cell.
    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
    necessarily distinct).
    You CANNOT go off the grid.
    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
    through (let&#39;s call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
    than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 &lt;= i &lt;= k)
    such that lst_A[i] &lt; lst_B[i] and for any j (1 &lt;= j &lt; i) we have
    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
    Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

    Examples:

        Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
        Output: [1, 2, 1]

        Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1
        Output: [1]

    # calculate sum
    total_sum = sum(q)
    # check if sum &lt;=w
    return is_palindrome and (total_sum &lt;= w)

Yes, that&#39;s straightforward.

But wait, what if q is empty? Well, according to the examples, the fourth example has [3], which is a single element. An empty list would be a palindrome (since it&#39;s the same when reversed). But the problem says &#34;object q&#34;, which might imply that q is non-empty. However, the problem doesn&#39;t specify, so we have to handle it as per the code. For example, an empty list would sum to 0, and if w is &gt;=0, it would return True. But since the examples don&#39;t cover that, perhaps the function is intended to handle any list, including empty ones. But according to the problem statement, the function is supposed to return True if the conditions are met. So the code as written would handle that.

Testing the examples:

For will_it_fly([1,2],5): q is [1,2], reversed is [2,1], not equal. So is_palindrome is False. So returns False. Correct.

will_it_fly([3,2,3],1): sum is 8 &gt;1 → returns False. Correct.

will_it_fly([3,2,3],9): sum 8&lt;=9 and palindrome → True. Correct.

will_it_fly([3],5): sum 3&lt;=5 and palindrome → True. Correct.

Looks like the code works for these cases.

I think that&#39;s all. Now write the code accordingly.
&lt;/think&gt;

def will_it_fly(q, w):
    &#39;&#39;&#39;Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
    The object q will fly if it&#39;s balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.&#39;&#39;&#39;
    return q == q[::-1] and sum(q) &lt;= w</pre>

Wait, but what about when n is 3? The loop would run from 3 to sqrt(3) which is ~1.7, so the loop doesn&#39;t execute. So returns True. Which is correct.

Yes, that seems right.

I think that&#39;s the correct implementation. Now, let me make sure there are no errors.

For example, n=4: is_prime(4) checks 2, which is even, returns False. So x_or_y(4, ..., ...) returns y.

Another example: n=9. The loop runs from 3 to 3 (sqrt(9)=3). So checks 3. 9%3==0 → returns False. Correct.

Yes, looks good.

            pos.append(num)
    a = max(negs) if negs else None
    b = min(pos) if pos else None
    return (a, b)

Wait, but what if the list has both negatives and positives? Like [-3, 2], then a is -3 (max of negs), b is 2 (min of pos). Which is correct.

Yes.

I think this should handle all cases. Testing the sample inputs.

Sample 1: [2,4,1,3,5,7] → negs is empty → a is None. pos is [2,4,1,3,5,7], min is 1. So (None, 1). Correct.

Sample 2: [] → both lists empty → (None, None). Correct.

Sample 3: [0] → both lists empty → (None, None). Correct.

Another test case: [-5, -3, -1] → negs is [-5,-3,-1], max is -1. pos is empty → ( -1, None )

Another case: [1, 2, -3] → negs is [-3], max is -3. pos is [1,2], min is 1. So (-3, 1). Correct.

Looks good. So the code should work.
&lt;/think&gt;

def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    negs = []
    pos = []
    for num in lst:
        if num &lt; 0:
            negs.append(num)
        elif num &gt; 0:
            pos.append(num)
    a = max(negs) if negs else None
    b = min(pos) if pos else None
    return (a, b)</pre>

Wait, but the problem says the output should be a string of the binary number. So yes, that&#39;s exactly what this does. So this code should handle all cases correctly.

I think that&#39;s it. Let me test some more cases mentally.

Another example: N=5 → sum is 5 → binary 101 → &#39;101&#39;.

Yes. So the code should work.

    <pre>    if char in freq:
        freq[char] += 1
    else:
        freq[char] = 1

Yes, that would work.

Once frequencies are counted, get the max value. max_count = max(freq.values(), default=0)

Wait, but if the input is empty, we already handled that. So in the non-empty case, the freq will have at least one entry.

Then collect all chars with freq[char] == max_count.

Then create the result dict as {char: count for char, count in freq.items() if count == max_count}

Wait, but the example shows that for &#39;a b c&#39;, the output is {&#39;a&#39;:1, &#39;b&#39;:1, &#39;c&#39;:1}, which is exactly that.

So putting it all together.

But wait, in the sample input &#39;a b c a b&#39;, the output is {&#39;a&#39;:2, &#39;b&#39;:2}. So the code needs to collect all entries that have the maximum count.

So the code steps:

Handle empty input.

Split into list.

Count frequencies.

Find max count.

Collect all keys with that count.

Return those as a dictionary.

So coding that.

Testing some examples:

For &#39;a b c&#39;, after splitting, the freq is {&#39;a&#39;:1, &#39;b&#39;:1, &#39;c&#39;:1} → max is 1, so all are included.

For &#39;a b b a&#39;, freq is {&#39;a&#39;:2, &#39;b&#39;:2} → max is 2, so both are included.

Another example: &#39;b b b b a&#39; → freq {&#39;b&#39;:4, &#39;a&#39;:1} → max is 4, so {&#39;b&#39;:4}.

Empty string returns {}.

What about if the input is something like &#39;a a a&#39;? Then the output is {&#39;a&#39;:3}.

Now, implementing this in code.

Potential issues: What if the input has multiple spaces? Like &#39;a   b&#39; → split would still give [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;].

Also, the input is supposed to be space-separated lowercase letters. So the split is safe.

Now, writing the code:

def histogram(test):
    if not test:
        return {}
    freq = {}
    for char in test.split():
        if char in freq:
            freq[char] += 1
        else:
            freq[char] = 1
    max_count = max(freq.values())
    result = {k: v for k, v in freq.items() if v == max_count}
    return result

Wait, but in the example given, the first example returns {&#39;a&#39;:1, &#39;b&#39;:1, &#39;c&#39;:1}, which is correct. But according to the code, when the max is 1, all entries are included.

Yes. That seems right.

Testing the code against the samples:

Sample 1: &#39;a b c&#39; → split into [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;]. All counts 1. Max is 1. Result is all three.

Sample 2: &#39;a b b a&#39; → counts a:2, b:2. Max is 2. Both included.

Sample 3: &#39;a b c a b&#39; → counts a:2, b:2, c:1. Max is 2. So a and b.

Sample 4: &#39;b b b b a&#39; → b:4, a:1. Max is 4. Only b.

Sample 5: &#39;&#39; → returns {}.

Yes, looks correct.

I think this should work. Now, make sure that the code handles the cases correctly. Also, note that the split() method without any arguments splits on any whitespace, including multiple spaces, tabs, etc., but the problem states that the input is space-separated, so it&#39;s okay.

Therefore, the code should be as written above.
&lt;/think&gt;

def histogram(test):
    if not test:
        return {}
    freq = {}
    for char in test.split():
        if char in freq:
            freq[char] += 1
        else:
            freq[char] = 1
    max_count = max(freq.values())
    result = {k: v for k, v in freq.items() if v == max_count}
    return result</pre>

    <pre>    # Handle the case where num is 0
    if num == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    # Take absolute value to handle negatives
    num_abs = abs(num)
    s = str(num_abs)
    even_count = 0

    for ch in s:
        digit = int(ch)

            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    return (even_count, odd_count)

Wait, but what if num is 0? The code checks if num is 0 and returns (1,0). But let&#39;s see: when num is 0, the code converts to string &#34;0&#34;, loops through &#39;0&#39;, which is even. So even_count is 1, odd_count 0. So the code works. However, in the initial code, the if num ==0 condition may not be necessary because the loop will handle it. Let me see:

If num is 0, then num_abs is 0, s is &#34;0&#34;. Loop runs once. digit is 0, even. So even_count is 1, odd 0. So returning (1,0). So the code without the if statement would work. So perhaps the check is redundant. So maybe the code can be simplified.

But perhaps including the check is better. Or maybe not. Let me think. Suppose num is 0, then the code proceeds to convert to string, loop through, etc. So the code can be written without that check. So maybe the code can be written as:

def even_odd_count(num):
    num_abs = abs(num)
    s = str(num_abs)
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    for ch in s:
        digit = int(ch)
        if digit % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    return (even_count, odd_count)

Testing this with num=0 gives (1,0), which is correct. So why the initial check? Maybe it&#39;s unnecessary. So the code can be written without that.

So the final code would be as above.

Now, checking the sample inputs:

For -12: num_abs is 12 → &#39;12&#39;. digits 1 (odd), 2 (even). So (1,1). Correct.

For 123 → &#39;123&#39; → 1 (odd), 2 (even), 3 (odd). So even_count 1, odd 2. Correct.

Yes, that seems right.

Therefore, the code should be implemented as such.
&lt;/think&gt;

def even_odd_count(num):
    num_abs = abs(num)
    s = str(num_abs)
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    for ch in s:
        digit = int(ch)
        if digit % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1

        result.append(template.replace(&#39;i&#39;, str(count)))
    return result

Wait, but the sample outputs have &#34;elements 4n&#34; instead of &#34;elements 4&#34;. Let me check. Oh no, because the template is &#34;elements i n&#34;. When replacing &#39;i&#39; with 4, it becomes &#34;elements 4n&#34;. Which is indeed present in the first sample output. Yes, that&#39;s correct.

Yes, this seems to work. Testing against the samples:

First sample:

[&#39;1234567&#39;] → count is 4. Template becomes:

the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput.

Which matches the expected output.

Another test case: [&#39;3&#39;, &#39;11111111&#39;] → the first string has count 1, the second 8. Outputs match the examples.

But wait, in the sample output for the second example, the first output is &#34;the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.&#34; which is exactly what our code produces.

So this code should work.

But wait, the template is &#34;the number of odd elements i n the str i ng i of the i nput.&#34; — but the sample output for the first example has &#34;the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput.&#34; So the code is correct.

Thus, the implementation is straightforward. Now, code-wise, the function loops through each string in the input list, computes the count of odd digits, then replaces all &#39;i&#39;s in the template with the count as a string.

But wait, the problem mentions that the input is a list of strings, each consisting of only digits. So converting each character to integer is safe.

Potential edge cases:

What if a string is empty? According to the problem statement, the input strings consist of only digits, but perhaps they can be empty. However, the examples don&#39;t include such a case. If a string is empty, the count is zero. The template would become &#34;the number of odd elements 0n the str0ng 0 of the 0nput.&#34; which is acceptable.

Another case: a string with even digits. E.g., &#39;2468&#39; → count is 0. The output would be &#34;the number of odd elements 0n the str0ng 0 of the 0nput.&#34;

So the code handles those cases.

Thus, the final code is as outlined.
&lt;/think&gt;

def odd_count(lst):
    template = &#34;the number of odd elements i n the str i ng i of the i nput.&#34;
    result = []

def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and 
    the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric 
    expression and return the evaluation of this expression.

    The basic algebra operations:
    Addition ( + ) 
    Subtraction ( - ) 
    Multiplication ( * ) 
    Floor division ( // ) 
    Exponentiation ( ** ) 

    Example:
    operator[&#39;+&#39;, &#39;*&#39;, &#39;-&#39;]
    array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
    =&gt; result = 9

    Note:
        The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
        Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
        Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.

    <pre>    expression_parts.append(operators[i])
    expression_parts.append(str(operands[i+1]))
expression = &#39;&#39;.join(expression_parts)

Wait, but that would produce something like &#34;2+3*4-5&#34; which is valid. Then, eval(&#34;2+3*4-5&#34;) would give 9.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the code would look like:

def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    expr = &#39;&#39;
    expr += str(operand[0])
    for o, num in zip(operator, operand[1:]):
        expr += f&#39; {o} {num}&#39;
    return eval(expr)

Wait, but in Python, the eval function would process the string as a mathematical expression. However, the operators in the operator list are symbols like &#39;+&#39;, &#39;-&#39;, etc., which are valid in Python expressions.

Testing this with the sample input:

operator = [&#39;+&#39;, &#39;*&#39;, &#39;-&#39;], operand = [2,3,4,5]

expr becomes &#34;2 + 3 * 4 - 5&#34;, which evaluates to 9. Correct.

Another test case: operator [&#39;*&#39;, &#39;+&#39;], operand [2,3,4] → &#34;2 * 3 + 4&#34; → 6 +4 = 10. Correct.

What about exponents? If operator includes &#39;**&#39;, then the expression would include that. Like operator [&#39;**&#39;, &#39;+&#39;], operand [2,3,4] → 2**3+4 = 8+4=12. Correct.

Floor division is &#39;//&#39;. So operator [&#39;//&#39;, &#39;/&#39;], operand [7, 2, 3] → 7//2 /3 → 3/3=1. But wait, the actual expression is 7//2 /3 → 3 /3 = 1. But if the operator list was [&#39;/&#39;, &#39;//&#39;], operand [7, 2, 3], then it would be 7/2 //3 → 3.5 //3 → 3//3=1. Hmm, but in Python, the division operator &#39;/&#39; returns float, but &#39;//&#39; returns integer. So the code would handle that correctly.

But the problem states that operands are non-negative integers, so all operations should be valid.

Potential issues: What if the operator list contains invalid characters? But according to the problem statement, the operator list consists of the allowed operations, so we don&#39;t need to validate that.

So the code would be:

def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    expression = str(operand[0])
    for op, num in zip(operator, operand[1:]):
        expression += f&#39; {op} {num}&#39;
    return eval(expression)

Wait, but in Python, when you use eval(), it&#39;s important that the expression is properly formatted. For example, if the operators are in the middle, but the code builds the expression correctly.

Yes, this should work.

Testing another example: operator [&#39;-&#39;, &#39;+&#39;], operand [10, 5, 3] → 10 -5 +3 → 8. Which is correct.

Another edge case: operator is [&#39;**&#39;], operand [2,3] → 2**3 =8. Correct.

Another case: operator is [&#39;//&#39;, &#39;**&#39;], operand [8, 2, 3] → 8//2 **3 → 4 **3 → 64. Because exponentiation has higher precedence than floor division. So yes, the code would evaluate that correctly.

So this approach should work.

Therefore, the implementation is as above.
&lt;/think&gt;

def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    expression = str(operand[0])
    for op, num in zip(operator, operand[1:]):
        expression += f&#39; {op} {num}&#39;
    return eval(expression)</pre>

Wait, because range(n+1) starts at 0 and goes up to n. Because range(0, n+1) is equivalent to range(n+1). So yes, that&#39;s correct.

So the code is simple. Let me check edge cases. If n is -1, then range(-1 +1) is range(0), which is empty. So the function would return an empty string. But according to the problem statement, maybe that&#39;s acceptable. The problem didn&#39;t mention handling such cases, so perhaps the function is designed for n &gt;=0. But since the function&#39;s parameters allow any integer, perhaps the code should handle that. However, the examples provided don&#39;t include such cases, so the code as written will work for the given examples and for valid inputs.

Thus, the implementation is as above.

That&#39;s it. The tests provided in the docstring should pass with this code. Let me check the examples again. For empty string, len(&#39;&#39;) is 0. For &#39;abc&#39;, len is 3. Yep, correct.

I don&#39;t see any issues here. The function is simple and uses the standard len() function. There&#39;s no need for additional checks since the parameters are properly typed.

    <pre>    return [n + 2 * i for i in range(n)]

But wait, let me confirm with the sample input.

Sample Input: make_a_pile(3) returns [3,5,7], which matches.

Another example: n=4 (even) → [4,6,8,10].

Yes.

So this seems to solve the problem correctly.

But why did the problem specify that the next level is next odd or even based on n&#39;s parity? Because if n were even, the next level is next even, which is adding 2. Similarly for odd. So the code works regardless of the parity.

Thus, the solution is straightforward. The function generates an arithmetic sequence starting at n, with common difference 2, for n terms.

Hence, the implementation is as above.
&lt;/think&gt;

def make_a_pile(n):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones. Each subsequent level increases by 2,
    ensuring the sequence is all odd if n is odd, or all even if n is even.
    Returns the number of stones in each level in a list.&#34;&#34;&#34;

That&#39;s straightforward. Let me make sure there&#39;s no edge cases. For example, a single-element list? But the problem says the list is non-empty. However, if the list has one element, its index is 0 (even), so no elements at odd indices. So sum is 0. Which is handled correctly.

Another case: list with two elements. Like [3, 4]. Index 0 (3, even index, ignore), index 1 (4, even). So sum is 4. Correct.

Yes, this should work.

This should work. Let me test some edge cases.

Case where two elements are exactly equal: e.g., [1.0, 1.0], threshold 0.0. The difference is 0.0, which is not less than 0.0. So returns False. But if threshold is 0.1, then returns True.

Another case: [1.0, 2.0], threshold 0.9. Difference is 1.0, which is not less than 0.9 → returns False.

Another case: [1.0, 1.0], threshold 0.0 → returns False. But if threshold is 0.0, then the condition is whether the difference is less than 0.0, which can&#39;t happen. So returns False.

What if the list has more than two elements but no close pairs? Like [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], threshold 0.5 → returns False.

All tests seem covered.

I think this implementation meets the requirements.

    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...

    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.
    Examples:

    <pre>    return txt.split()
elif &#39;,&#39; in txt:
    return txt.split(&#39;,&#39;)
else:
    # calculate the count

For the else case, iterate over each character in txt, check if it&#39;s a lowercase letter. For those that are, compute (ord(c) - ord(&#39;a&#39;)), check if it&#39;s odd. Sum all such instances.

So in code:

count = 0
for char in txt:
    if char.islower():
        pos = ord(char) - ord(&#39;a&#39;)
        if pos % 2 == 1:
            count +=1
return count

Putting it all together.

Testing examples:

Example 1: &#34;Hello world!&#34; → has space → split into [&#34;Hello&#34;, &#34;world!&#34;].

Second example: &#34;Hello,world!&#34; → comma present, split into [&#34;Hello&#34;, &#34;world!&#34;].

Third example: &#34;abcdef&#34; → no space or comma. Count the letters. As discussed, 3.

Another test case: what about a mix of letters and other characters? Like &#34;a,b,c,d&#34; → split on commas → [&#34;a&#34;,&#34;b&#34;,&#34;c&#34;,&#34;d&#34;].

What if the string is empty? Probably, according to the problem statement, but since the function is supposed to handle all cases, but the problem examples don&#39;t cover that. But according to the logic, if there are no spaces or commas, then process the count. For an empty string, there are no letters, so return 0.

Edge case: uppercase letters. The problem says to count lowercase letters. So uppercase letters are ignored.

Another edge case: &#34;abcDef&#34; → &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39; are lowercase. D is uppercase, so ignore. &#39;e&#39; is lowercase. So positions: a(0) even, b(1) odd, c(2) even, e(4) even. So count is 1 (only &#39;b&#39;).

So code seems solid.

Now write the Python function accordingly.

    <pre>    vowels = {&#39;a&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;u&#39;}
    result = []
    for c in message:
        # Step 1: swap case
        swapped_c = c.swapcase()
        # Step 2: check if it&#39;s a vowel
        if swapped_c.lower() in vowels:
            # Step 3: replace with two letters ahead
            original_lower = swapped_c.lower()
            index = ord(original_lower) - ord(&#39;a&#39;)
            new_index = (index + 2) % 26
            new_char = chr(ord(&#39;a&#39;) + new_index)
            result.append(new_char)
        else:
            result.append(swapped_c)
    return &#39;&#39;.join(result)

Testing this code with the first example:

encode(&#39;test&#39;)

Process each character:

t -&gt; swapped is T. T is not a vowel. Append T.

e -&gt; swapped is E. E is a vowel. Lowercase is e. index is 4. Add 2 → 6 → &#39;g&#39;. So append &#39;G&#39;.

s -&gt; swapped is S. Not a vowel. Append S.

t -&gt; swapped is T. Not a vowel. Append T.

Result is T G S T → &#39;TGST&#39; which matches the sample.

Second example: encode(&#39;This is a message&#39;) → expected output &#39;tHKS KS C MGSSCGG&#39;.

Let me walk through some parts.

Take the first character &#39;T&#39; → swapped is &#39;t&#39;. Not a vowel. Appended as &#39;t&#39;.

Next &#39;h&#39; → swapped is &#39;H&#39;. Not a vowel. Appended as &#39;H&#39;.

Third character &#39;i&#39;: swapped is &#39;I&#39;. It&#39;s a vowel. Lowercase is &#39;i&#39;. Index 8. +2 = 10 → &#39;k&#39;. So appended &#39;K&#39;.

Fourth character &#39;s&#39; → swapped is &#39;S&#39;. Not a vowel. Appended as &#39;S&#39;.

Space remains same.

Fifth character &#39;i&#39; → swapped is &#39;I&#39;. vowel. becomes K.

Sixth &#39;s&#39; → S. Not vowel.

Space.

Seventh &#39;a&#39; → swapped is &#39;A&#39;. vowel. index 0 +2 = 2 → &#39;C&#39;.

Then space, &#39;m&#39; → swapped is &#39;M&#39;. Not vowel. etc.

Yes, seems correct.

What about uppercase vowels in the original message?

Like if the input is &#39;Apple&#39;, then the &#39;P&#39; is uppercase. After swapping, it&#39;s p (lowercase). Not a vowel. Then &#39;p&#39; is not a vowel. Then &#39;p&#39; is not a vowel. Then &#39;l&#39; becomes L. Not a vowel. Then &#39;e&#39; becomes E. Which is a vowel. Shift to G. So overall, the encoded string would be &#39;pPLLG&#39;.

Another test case: &#39;Hello World&#39; → swap case → &#39;hELLO wORLD&#39;. Then replace vowels:

&#39;h&#39; → h (not vowel). &#39;E&#39; → vowel. E becomes G. &#39;L&#39; → not. &#39;L&#39; → not. &#39;O&#39; → vowel. O becomes Q. Space. W → not. O → vowel → Q. R → not. L → not. D → not. So the result would be &#39;hEGQ wQQLD&#39;.

But I think the code handles that correctly.

Potential edge cases: messages with uppercase vowels. For example, &#39;AEIOUaeiou&#39; → after swapping case, becomes &#39;aeiouAEIOU&#39;. Then each vowel is replaced. Let&#39;s see:

Each &#39;a&#39; becomes &#39;c&#39;, &#39;e&#39; → &#39;g&#39;, &#39;i&#39; → k, &#39;o&#39; → q, &#39;u&#39; → w. Then for uppercase vowels: &#39;A&#39; becomes &#39;C&#39;, &#39;E&#39; → &#39;G&#39;, etc.

So the code should work.

So the code looks correct. Now, writing the function accordingly.
&lt;/think&gt;

def encode(message):
    vowels = {&#39;a&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;u&#39;}

    for c in message:
        swapped_c = c.swapcase()

    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that&#39;s moving left to right hits a car that&#39;s moving right to left.

def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.
    The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The
    strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase
    letters in the extension&#39;s name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters 
    in the extension&#39;s name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM. 
    You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this 
    format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.
    If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should
    choose the one that comes first in the list.
    For example, if you are given &#34;Slices&#34; as the class and a list of the
    extensions: [&#39;SErviNGSliCes&#39;, &#39;Cheese&#39;, &#39;StuFfed&#39;] then you should
    return &#39;Slices.SErviNGSliCes&#39; since &#39;SErviNGSliCes&#39; is the strongest extension

    Example:

That&#39;s straightforward. Let me check the examples again. For empty list, returns &#39;&#39;, which is correct. For [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;], joins them into &#39;abc&#39;. That&#39;s right. So this should work.

I don&#39;t think there are any edge cases beyond that. Even if the list has one element, like [&#39;x&#39;], it would return &#39;x&#39;, which is correct. So the code seems to handle all cases.
&lt;/think&gt;

Wait, but the extension is checked as exact match. But the problem says the substring after the dot should be one of those. So the ext must be exactly &#39;txt&#39;, &#39;exe&#39;, or &#39;dll&#39;. So the code above does that.

But what about if the extension is &#39;TXT&#39;? Because the code checks for exact matches. Oh, but the problem says the extension must be one of those. So the code is correct here because the example shows that &#34;1example.dll&#34; is invalid because the base starts with a digit. But in the code, the ext is checked as exact. So if someone writes &#34;file.EXE&#34;, the code would return &#39;No&#39; because the ext is &#39;EXE&#39;, which isn&#39;t in the list. But according to the problem statement, the extension must be exactly one of those. Therefore, the code is correct.

But wait, the problem says the substring after the dot should be one of those. So the code checks if ext is in the list. So the code is correct.

But what about if the extension is longer than 3 letters? Like &#39;txtx&#39;? The code would check if it&#39;s in the list, which it&#39;s not. So that&#39;s handled correctly.

Another possible issue: leading zeros in the base part. For example, &#34;0example.txt&#34; → base starts with &#39;0&#39; which is not a letter → returns &#39;No&#39;, which is correct.

Another edge case: filename with all digits except the first character. Like &#34;a123.txt&#34; → digits count is 3 → allowed.

Another case: &#34;aaa.txt&#34; → digits count is 0 → allowed.

What about a filename like &#34;a.txt1&#34;? Split into [&#34;a&#34;, &#34;txt1&#34;] → ext is &#39;txt1&#39; which is not in the list → returns &#39;No&#39;.

Thus, the code seems to cover all the required conditions.

Testing the sample inputs:

Sample 1: &#34;example.txt&#34; → split into [&#34;example&#34;, &#34;txt&#34;]. base starts with &#39;e&#39; → yes. ext is txt. digits count 0 → yes → returns &#39;Yes&#39;.

Sample 2: &#34;1example.dll&#34; → split into [&#34;1example&#34;, &#34;dll&#34;]. base starts with &#39;1&#39; → not alpha → returns &#39;No&#39;.

Which matches the example.

Another test case: &#34;file123.txt&#34; → digits count is 3 → allowed. Returns &#39;Yes&#39;.

Another test case: &#34;file1234.txt&#34; → digits count 4 → returns &#39;No&#39;.

Another case: &#34;file.txt&#34; → valid → &#39;Yes&#39;.

Case with invalid extension: &#34;file.doc&#34; → returns &#39;No&#39;.

Case with multiple dots: &#34;file.name.txt&#34; → split into [&#34;file&#34;, &#34;name&#34;, &#34;txt&#34;] → len(parts) is 3 → returns &#39;No&#39;.

Case with empty base: &#34;.txt&#34; → split into [&#34;&#34;, &#34;txt&#34;] → base is empty → returns &#39;No&#39;.

All these seem covered.

I think this implementation meets all the criteria.
&lt;/think&gt;

def file_name_check(file_name):
    parts = file_name.split(&#39;.&#39;)
    if len(parts) != 2:

    base, ext = parts

            if next_char not in vowels and prev_char not in vowels:
                return current
    return &#34;&#34;

Testing this against the sample inputs.

Sample 1: &#34;yogurt&#34;

len(word)=6. len-2=4. Loop i from 4 downto 1:

i=4: &#39;r&#39; (consonant). i=3: &#39;u&#39; (vowel). next_char is word[4] = &#39;r&#39; (consonant). prev_char is word[2] = &#39;g&#39; (consonant). So return &#39;u&#39;. Correct.

Sample 2: &#34;FULL&#34; → len is 4. len-2=2. i ranges from 2 downto 1.

i=2: &#39;L&#39; (consonant). i=1: &#39;U&#39; (vowel). next_char is word[2] = &#39;L&#39; (consonant). prev_char is word[0] = &#39;F&#39; (consonant). So return &#39;U&#39;. Correct.

Sample 3: &#34;quick&#34; → len 5. len-2=3. i=3,2,1.

i=3: &#39;c&#39; consonant. i=2: &#39;i&#39; vowel. next_char is word[3] = &#39;c&#39; (consonant). prev_char is word[1] = &#39;u&#39; (vowel). So prev is not consonant. So no. i=1: &#39;u&#39; vowel. next_char is word[2] = &#39;i&#39; (vowel). So no. thus returns &#39;&#39;. Correct.

Sample 4: &#34;ab&#34; → len 2. len-2=0. loop from 0 downto 1 → no iterations. returns &#34;&#34;. Correct.

Another test case: &#34;abba&#34; → len 4. len-2=2. i=2,1.

i=2: &#39;b&#39; consonant. i=1: &#39;b&#39; consonant. So no vowels. returns &#34;&#34;.

Another test case: &#34;aeiou&#34; → len 5. len-2=3. i=3,2,1.

i=3: &#39;u&#39; vowel. next is &#39;o&#39; (vowel), so no. i=2: &#39;o&#39; vowel. next is &#39;i&#39; (vowel). no. i=1: &#39;i&#39; vowel. next is &#39;e&#39; (vowel). no. returns &#34;&#34;.

Another case: &#34;bcdfghjklqwrtyuiopasdfghjkl;&#39;&#34; — probably complex, but the code should handle it.

So, the code looks correct. Now, write the code accordingly.

    <pre>    if len(l) &lt; 2:
        return True

    # Check non-increasing
    non_increasing = all( l[i] &gt;= l[i+1] for i in range(len(l)-1) )
    return non_decreasing or non_increasing

Wait, but what if the list is empty? Like, if l is empty, then len(l) is 0, so the first condition returns True. So that&#39;s handled.

Testing the sample cases.

Sample 1: [1,2,4,20]. Non-decreasing is True. So returns True.

Sample 2: [1,20,4,10]. Check non-decreasing: 1&lt;=20 is True, 20&lt;=4 is False. So non-decreasing is False. Non-increasing: 1&gt;=20 is False. So overall returns False.

Sample3: [4,1,0,-10]. Non-increasing: 4&gt;=1 (True), 1&gt;=0 (True), 0&gt;=-10 (True). So returns True.

Yes, that works.

What about a list that is both non-decreasing and non-increasing? Like [5,5,5]. Then both conditions are True, so returns True.

Another case: [1,3,2]. Non-decreasing? 1&lt;=3 yes, 3&lt;=2 no. So non-decreasing is false. Non-increasing? 1&gt;=3 no. So returns false.

So the code seems correct.

I think that&#39;s the solution.

    if len(l) &lt; 2:
        return True
    non_decreasing = all(l[i] &lt;= l[i+1] for i in range(len(l)-1))

    <pre>    bit_a = int(a[i])
    bit_b = int(b[i])
    xor_bit = bit_a ^ bit_b
    result.append(str(xor_bit))
return &#39;&#39;.join(result)

That seems straightforward.

Testing the example: &#39;010&#39; and &#39;110&#39;.

Indices 0: 0 vs 1 → 1

Index 1: 1 vs 1 → 0

Index 2: 0 vs 0 → 0 → gives &#39;100&#39;, which matches the sample.

Yes, that works.

So the code would look like this.

Another test case: if a is &#39;000&#39; and b is &#39;111&#39;, the result is &#39;111&#39;.

What if one of the strings is shorter? Suppose a is &#39;101&#39; and b is &#39;10&#39;? Then, the code would crash because len(a) is 3 and len(b) is 2. But according to the problem&#39;s description, perhaps the inputs are guaranteed to be same length. So the code can proceed.

Thus, the implementation is as above.

Now, writing the code inside the function.

So the function is:

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -&gt; str:
    result = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        # Ensure that the indices are within bounds for both strings
        # But assuming that a and b are same length, as per problem&#39;s examples
        bit_a = int(a[i])
        bit_b = int(b[i])
        xor_bit = bit_a ^ bit_b
        result.append(str(xor_bit))
    return &#39;&#39;.join(result)

Wait, but what if the strings are of different lengths? For example, if a is longer than b, then when i reaches beyond len(b), it would throw an IndexError. But the problem&#39;s docstring says that the inputs consist of 1s and 0s, but doesn&#39;t mention their lengths. However, the sample shows same length. Therefore, the code is correct under the assumption that the inputs are of same length.

Therefore, this code should work.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should pad the shorter string with zeros. But the problem statement does not mention that. Hence, the code as written is acceptable.

Hence, the final code is as above.
&lt;/think&gt;

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -&gt; str:
    result = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        bit_a = int(a[i])
        bit_b = int(b[i])
        xor_bit = bit_a ^ bit_b
        result.append(str(xor_bit))
    return &#39;&#39;.join(result)</pre>

    n = len(s)
    if shift &gt; n:
        return s[::-1]
    else:
        return s[-shift:] + s[:-shift]

That should cover all cases. Now, checking edge cases like shift=0. Well, according to the problem statement, the function is supposed to shift right by shift. Shift=0 would leave it as is. But the problem doesn&#39;t mention handling shift=0, but according to the code, if shift is 0, then s[-0:] is empty (since -0 is 0), but in Python, s[-0:] is same as s[0:], which is the entire string. Wait, no. Wait, in Python, negative indices are allowed. But -shift when shift is zero would be 0. So s[-0:] is same as s[0:], which is the whole string. So s[-0:] + s[:-0] → s[0:] + s[:0] → s + &#39;&#39; → s. So for shift=0, it returns the original string. That&#39;s correct.

What about when x is 0? Like x=0, shift=1. Then s is &#39;0&#39;, len is 1. shift is 1, which is not greater than 1. So shifted is s[-1:] + s[:-1] → &#39;0&#39; + &#39;&#39; → &#39;0&#39;. Correct.

Another case: x=1, shift=1. len is 1. shift is not &gt;1. So shifted is s[-1:] + s[:-1] → &#39;1&#39; + &#39;&#39; → &#39;1&#39;.

So the code handles those cases correctly.

Thus, the implementation should be as above.
&lt;/think&gt;

def circular_shift(x, shift):
    s = str(x)
    n = len(s)
    if shift &gt; n:
        return s[::-1]
    else:
        return s[-shift:] + s[:-shift]</pre>

    <pre>    a = abs(a)

    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

Wait, let me check. Suppose a is 0? Wait, according to the problem statement, the function is called with two integers. But if a is 0 and b is non-zero, then the GCD is |b|. For example, GCD(0, 5) is 5. Similarly, GCD(0, 0) is undefined, but perhaps the function will return 0 in that case. However, the problem&#39;s examples don&#39;t cover this. But since the function is supposed to handle any integers, including zeros, we need to make sure.

But according to the Euclidean algorithm, if a is 0 and b is not zero, then the GCD is |b|. If both are zero, then it&#39;s undefined, but perhaps the function returns 0. Let&#39;s see.

In our code, when a is 0 and b is non-zero, the loop will run once. Let&#39;s say a=0, b=5. Then in the loop, since b is not zero, a and b become 5 and 0%5=0. Then the loop exits, and returns 5. Which is correct.

If both a and b are zero, then the code will enter the loop with a=0, b=0. The loop condition is b !=0, which is false, so it returns a=0. But technically, GCD(0,0) is undefined. However, the problem may expect that. The function&#39;s documentation doesn&#39;t specify handling this case, but since the examples don&#39;t include it, perhaps the code is acceptable.

Therefore, the code seems correct. Let me write that.
&lt;/think&gt;

def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int:
    a = abs(a)
    b = abs(b)
    while b != 0:

    return &#34;&#34;.join(groups)

Testing this with sample inputs.

Test case 1: Encode &#34;abcde&#34;.

Encode steps: split into groups of 3.

Original s is &#34;abcde&#34;

Groups:

i=0: 0-3: &#34;abc&#34;

i=1: 3-6: &#34;de&#34; (since len(s)=5, min(3*1+3=6, 5) is 5. So group is s[3:5] = &#34;de&#34;.

So groups are [&#34;abc&#34;, &#34;de&#34;].

Encoding each group:

First group: &#34;abc&#34; → group[1:] + group[0] → &#34;bc&#34;+&#34;a&#34; → &#34;bca&#34;.

Second group remains &#34;de&#34;.

Resulting encoded string is &#34;bca de&#34; → &#34;bcd e&#34;?

Wait, no, the joined result is &#34;bca&#34; + &#34;de&#34; → &#34;bcade&#34;.

Decoding &#34;bcade&#34;:

Split into groups of 3:

Group 0: 0-3: &#34;bca&#34;

Group 1: 3-6: &#34;de&#34;.

Decode each group:

For &#34;bca&#34;: group[2] is &#39;a&#39;, group[0] is &#39;b&#39;, group[1] is &#39;c&#39; → &#34;acb&#34;?

Wait, according to our logic, group[2] + group[0] + group[1] → &#39;a&#39;+&#39;b&#39;+&#39;c&#39; → &#34;abc&#34;.

Yes. Then the second group is &#34;de&#34; remains as is. So decoded string is &#34;abcd e&#34; → &#34;abced&#34;? Wait, original was &#34;abcde&#34;, encoded became &#34;bcade&#34;. Decoded should be &#34;abcde&#34;.

Wait, let&#39;s check:

Encrypted string is &#34;bcade&#34;.

Breaking down:

Group 0: &#34;bca&#34; → decoded as &#34;a&#34; + &#34;b&#34; + &#34;c&#34; → &#34;abc&#34;.

Group 1: &#34;de&#34; → stays &#34;de&#34;.

Combined: &#34;abcde&#34; → correct.

Another test case: encode &#34;abcdefg&#34;.

Encoded groups:

Original: &#34;abcdefg&#34; → groups are &#34;abc&#34;, &#34;def&#34;, &#34;g&#34;.

After encoding:

Each group of 3 is rotated. So &#34;abc&#34; → &#34;bca&#34;, &#34;def&#34; → &#34;efd&#34;, &#34;g&#34; remains &#34;g&#34;.

Encoded string is &#34;bcaefd g&#34;.

Decoding &#34;bcaefd g&#34;:

Groups are &#34;bca&#34;, &#34;efd&#34;, &#34;g&#34;.

Decode &#34;bca&#34; → group[2] is &#39;a&#39;, group[0] is &#39;b&#39;, group[1] is &#39;c&#39; → &#34;abc&#34;.

Decode &#34;efd&#34; → group[2] is &#39;d&#39;, group[0] is &#39;e&#39;, group[1] is &#39;f&#39; → &#34;def&#34;.

&#34;g&#34; remains &#34;g&#34;.

Combined: &#34;abcdefg&#34; → correct.

So the code seems to work.

Thus, the decode_cyclic function should be implemented as above.
&lt;/think&gt;

def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    groups = [(group[2] + group[0] + group[1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return &#34;&#34;.join(groups)</pre>

    is_pal = filtered == filtered[::-1]
    return (filtered, is_pal)

Testing against the examples.

Example 1: s=&#34;abcde&#34;, c=&#34;ae&#34;. Filtering removes &#39;a&#39; and &#39;e&#39;, so &#34;bcd&#34;. Reverse of &#34;bcd&#34; is &#34;dcb&#34;, so false. Correct.

Second example: s=&#34;abcdef&#34;, c=&#34;b&#34;. Removing &#39;b&#39; gives &#34;acd ef&#34; (assuming spaces for clarity?), no, actual string is &#34;acdef&#34;. Reversed is &#34;fedca&#34;, which is different. So returns (acdef, False). Which matches the sample.

Third example: s=&#34;abcdedcba&#34;, c=&#34;ab&#34;. After removal, the string becomes &#34;cdedc&#34;. Reverse is &#34;ceddc&#34;? Wait, original string is abcd edcba. Removing a and b, so the remaining is c d e d c. So &#34;cdedc&#34;. Reverse is &#34;cdedc&#34;, which is same. So returns (cdedc, True). Correct.

What about edge cases?

Case where s is empty? Then filtered is empty, which is a palindrome. Returns (&#34;&#34;, True).

Another case: s is &#34;a&#34;, c is &#34;a&#34;. Then filtered is &#34;&#34;, which is a palindrome. So returns (&#34;&#34;, True).

Another test: s is &#34;aba&#34;, c is &#34;b&#34;. Filtered is &#34;aa&#34;, which is a palindrome. So returns (&#34;aa&#34;, True).

Yes, that seems correct.

I think this implementation covers all the required scenarios. Now, write the code accordingly.
&lt;/think&gt;

def reverse_delete(s, c):
    filtered = &#39;&#39;.join(ch for ch in s if ch not in c)

    <pre>    if not nums:
        return 0  # though per problem description, this shouldn&#39;t happen
    current_min = global_min = nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]:
        current_min = min(num, current_min + num)
        global_min = min(global_min, current_min)
    return global_min

Testing this against examples.

First example: [2,3,4,1,2,4]

current_min starts at 2, global_min 2.

Next 3: current_min is min(3, 2+3=5) → 3. global_min remains 2.

Then 4: min(4, 3+4=7) →4. global_min still 2.

Then 1: min(1, 4+1=5) →1. global_min becomes 1.

Then 2: min(2, 1+2=3) →2. global_min remains 1.

Then 4: min(4, 2+4=6) →4. So returns 1. Correct.

Second example: [-1,-2,-3].

current_min starts at -1, global_min -1.

next -2: current_min is min(-2, -1 + (-2) = -3) → -3. global_min is -3.

next -3: current_min is min(-3, -3 + (-3) = -6) →-6. global_min is -6. Correct.

What about a mix of positive and negatives?

Like [2, -1, 3]. The minimum is -1.

Let&#39;s simulate:

current_min starts at 2, global_min 2.

next -1: current_min is min(-1, 2 + (-1) =1) →-1. global_min is -1.

next 3: current_min is min(3, -1 +3=2) →2. global_min remains -1. So returns -1. Correct.

Another test case: [ -2, 1, -3 ]. The possible subarrays:

[-2] →-2; [-2,1]→-1; [-2,1,-3]→-4; [1]→1; [1,-3]→-2; [-3]→-3. The minimum is -4.

Let&#39;s run the code:

current_min starts at -2, global_min -2.

Next 1: current_min is min(1, -2 +1 =-1) →-1. global_min is -2.

Next -3: current_min is min(-3, -1 + (-3) =-4) →-4. global_min is now -4. Correct.

So the code seems to handle these cases.

Therefore, the implementation should be as above.
&lt;/think&gt;

def minSubArraySum(nums):
    current_min = global_min = nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]:
        current_min = min(num, current_min + num)
        global_min = min(global_min, current_min)
    return global_min</pre>

    <div class="content">
    <pre>    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2

Wait, but what if the inputs are zero or negative? Well, according to the problem statement, the function is given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. So presumably, the inputs are positive integers. However, the problem says nothing about validation. So the function doesn&#39;t need to handle invalid inputs like zeros or negatives. Because the examples use positive integers, and the problem states that the inputs are lengths of sides, which must be positive. So we can assume that the inputs are valid.

Therefore, the code should work.

Testing the sample cases:

Sample 1: 3,4,5 → sorted [3,4,5] → 9+16=25 → yes → True.

Sample 2: 1,2,3 → sorted [1,2,3] → 1+4=5 !=9 → False.

Another test case: 5, 12, 13 → True.

Another case: 5, 12, 12 → sorted [5,12,12]. 25 + 144 = 169. 12^2 is 144. 169 !=144 → False. So correct.

Another case: 1,1,√2 ≈1.414. So sorted [1,1,1.414]. 1+1=2, (1.414)^2≈2 → so returns True. Which is correct.

Thus, the code seems correct.
&lt;/think&gt;

    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2</pre>

            res += sym
            number -= val
    return res

Wait, but the code uses &#39;m&#39; instead of &#39;M&#39;? Because the examples show lowercase. Yes, the sample outputs are lowercase. So the code returns the correct strings.

Let me test with the first example.

number=19.

Processing:

Check 1000: no.

900: no.

500: no.

400: no.

100: no.

90: no.

50: no.

40: no.

10: yes. Add &#39;x&#39;, number becomes 9.

Then next is 9: yes. Add &#39;ix&#39;, number becomes 0. So res is &#39;xi&#39; + &#39;ix&#39;? Wait, no. Wait after processing 10, the number is 9. Then the next entry is 9, which is &#39;ix&#39;. So when the loop processes (9, &#39;ix&#39;), the number is 9, so add &#39;ix&#39; and subtract 9. So res is &#39;xix&#39;, which is correct.

Yes.

Similarly, for 152:

Process 100 (c): add c, number is 52.

Then 90: no.

50: yes. Add l, number is 2.

Then 40: no.

10: no.

9: no.

5: no.

4: no.

1: add i twice. So res is cl ii → &#39;clii&#39;, correct.

Looks good.

So the code should work.
&lt;/think&gt;

Testing against the examples:

encrypt(&#39;asdfghjkl&#39;) → asdfghjkl → each shifted by 4, as shown earlier, gives ewhjklnop ✔️

encrypt(&#39;gf&#39;) → g is 6 → 10 →k; f is 5 →9 →j → kj ✔️

encrypt(&#39;et&#39;) → e is 4 →8 →i; t is 19 →23 →x → ix ✔️

This seems correct. Also, if a character is &#39;y&#39; (24), adding 4 gives 28 mod26=2 → &#39;c&#39;; &#39;z&#39; (25) → 29 mod26=3 → &#39;d&#39;.

    <pre>       max_count = current_count
       result_word = word
   elif current_count == max_count:
       if word &lt; result_word:
           result_word = word

Wait, but what if there are multiple words with the same max count? For example, [&#34;enam&#34;, &#34;name&#34;], both have 4 unique chars. The lex order is &#39;enam&#39; vs &#39;name&#39;. Since &#39;enam&#39; comes before &#39;name&#39;, it should be selected. So during iteration, whenever a new word has the same count, compare it to the current result and replace if it&#39;s smaller.

Yes, that seems right. So the initial approach would work.

Now let&#39;s test some examples.

Test case 1: [&#34;name&#34;, &#34;of&#34;, &#34;string&#34;]

&#34;name&#34;: unique count is 4 (&#39;n&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;m&#39;,&#39;e&#39;)
&#34;of&#34;: 2 (&#39;o&#39;,&#39;f&#39;)
&#34;strings&#34;: s,t,r,i,n,g → 6 unique. So max is 6. So return &#34;string&#34;.

Another test case: [&#34;name&#34;, &#34;enam&#34;, &#34;game&#34;].

Each word&#39;s unique count:

&#34;name&#34;: 4
&#34;enam&#34;: e,n,a,m → 4
&#34;game&#34;: g,a,m,e → 4. All three have same count. Now compare lex order. The words are &#34;enam&#34;, &#34;game&#34;, &#34;name&#34;. Wait, original list is [&#34;name&#34;, &#34;enam&#34;, &#34;game&#34;]. Wait, no, the input is [&#34;name&#34;, &#34;enam&#34;, &#34;game&#34;]?

Wait the second example says find_max([&#34;name&#34;, &#34;enam&#34;, &#34;game&#34;]) == &#34;enam&#34;. Because among the three, they all have 4 unique letters. Lex order: &#34;enam&#34; comes before &#34;game&#34;? Let&#39;s see. Comparing &#34;enam&#34; and &#34;game&#34;:

Compare first character: &#39;e&#39; vs &#39;g&#39;. &#39;e&#39; is earlier, so &#34;enam&#34; is lex smaller. Therefore, the correct answer is &#34;enam&#34;.

So according to our algorithm, when processing each word:

Initially, result_word is empty. Let&#39;s walk through:

Start with max_count = -inf, result_word = &#39;&#39;.

Process first word &#34;name&#34;:
current_count is 4. Since 4&gt; -inf, set max_count=4, result_word=&#34;name&#34;.

Next word &#34;enam&#34;: current_count is 4. Equal to max_count. Compare &#34;enam&#34; with current result (&#34;name&#34;). Which is lex smaller? &#34;enam&#34; is smaller because &#39;e&#39; comes before &#39;n&#39;. So update result_word to &#34;enam&#34;.

Third word &#34;game&#34;: current_count is 4. Compare &#34;game&#34; with current result &#34;enam&#34;. &#34;game&#34; starts with &#39;g&#39;, which is after &#39;e&#39;, so &#34;enam&#34; remains. So final result is &#34;enam&#34;. Correct.

Another test case: [&#34;aaaaaaa&#34;, &#34;bb&#34;, &#34;cc&#34;]. The unique counts are 1, 1, 1. So all have same count. The lex order is &#34;aaaaaaa&#34; comes first. So the output should be &#34;aaaaaaa&#34;.

In the sample given, the expected output is &#34;aaaaaaa&#34;, which matches.

So the algorithm works here.

Edge cases: What if the list is empty? According to the problem statement, the function is supposed to accept a list of strings. However, the sample inputs don&#39;t include empty lists. But per the problem description, probably assume that the input is non-empty. But the function may need to handle empty lists? Well, the problem says &#34;list contains different words&#34;—so perhaps the input is non-empty. But the code needs to handle any valid input.

But according to the sample, for example, the third test case returns &#34;aaaaaaa&#34;, which is the first element. So the code must handle that.

Now, implementing this logic in Python.

The function is def find_max(words):

We can loop through each word in words. Initialize max_count as -infinity, and result_word as empty string.

Then for each word in words:

current_unique = len(set(word))

if current_unique &gt; max_count:

   max_count = current_unique

   result_word = word

elif current_unique == max_count:

   if word &lt; result_word:

      result_word = word

At the end, return result_word.

But wait, what if all words have zero unique characters? Like [&#34;&#34;, ...], but the problem states that the list contains different words. But the function is supposed to return the word with max unique. So if all words are empty, then the first one would be returned.

But according to the sample, the third test case returns &#34;aaaaaaa&#34;, which is the first element. So the code handles that.

Testing the third sample: [&#34;aaaaaaa&#34;, &#34;bb&#34;, &#34;cc&#34;].

Processing first word: &#34;aaaaaaa&#34; → unique count 1. Set max_count to 1, result_word is &#34;aaaaaaa&#34;.

Second word &#34;bb&#34;: unique count 1. Same as max. Compare &#34;bb&#34; with &#34;aaaaaaa&#34;. Since &#34;bb&#34; is lex larger, no change.

Third word &#34;cc&#34;: same as above. No change. Final result is &#34;aaaaaaa&#34;.

Yes.

Another edge case: [&#34;aaab&#34;, &#34;aab&#34;, &#34;aba&#34;, &#34;baa&#34;] → all have 3 unique characters. The lex order is &#34;aaab&#34; comes first. So the code would return &#34;aaab&#34;.

So the code seems correct.

Now, coding this.

Implementing in Python:

def find_max(words):
    max_count = -1
    result_word = &#34;&#34;
    for word in words:
        unique_chars = len(set(word))
        if unique_chars &gt; max_count:
            max_count = unique_chars
            result_word = word
        elif unique_chars == max_count:
            if word &lt; result_word:
                result_word = word
    return result_word

Wait, but what if the list is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, the function is supposed to accept a list of strings. But the problem says that the list contains different words. So perhaps the input is guaranteed to be non-empty. But the code would return an empty string if the list is empty. However, according to the samples provided, the third test case returns &#34;aaaaaaa&#34;, which is the first element. So the code is okay.

But in the sample, the third test case is [&#34;aaaaaaa&#34;, &#34;bb&#34;, &#34;cc&#34;], and the output is &#34;aaaaaaa&#34;. Which is handled correctly by the code.

Thus, the code should work.
&lt;/think&gt;

def find_max(words):
    max_count = -1
    result_word = &#34;&#34;
    for word in words:
        unique_chars = len(set(word))
        if unique_chars &gt; max_count:
            max_count = unique_chars
            result_word = word
        elif unique_chars == max_count:
            if word &lt; result_word:
                result_word = word
    return result_word</pre>

def move_one_ball(arr):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;We have an array &#39;arr&#39; of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
    the following operation on the given array:
        You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.
    
    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
    then return True else return False.
    If the given array is empty then return True.

    Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

    For Example:
    
    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==&gt;True
    Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
                 be achieved for the given array.
    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==&gt;False

    <pre>    if n &lt; 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

Yes, that&#39;s correct. Numbers less than 2 are not primes. Then check divisibility up to sqrt(n).

Now, applying this to each word&#39;s length.

Let me test the examples.

Example 1: &#34;This is a test&#34; → Words are [&#34;This&#34;, &#34;is&#34;, &#34;a&#34;, &#34;test&#34;]. Their lengths are 4, 2, 1, 4. Which of these are primes?

4 is not prime (divisible by 2). 2 is prime. 1 is not. 4 again. So the only word with prime length is &#34;is&#34;. So output is &#34;is&#34;.

Which matches the sample.

Second example: &#34;lets go for swimming&#34; → Words are [&#34;lets&#34;, &#34;go&#34;, &#34;for&#34;, &#34;swimming&#34;] → lengths 4, 2, 3, 8. Primes are 2 (go), 3 (for). So output is &#34;go for&#34;.

So the code should process each word, check if its length is prime, collect those words, then join with spaces.

Putting it all together:

Function words_in_sentence:

Split the sentence into words.

Filter each word based on whether len(word) is prime.

Join the filtered words with spaces.

Edge case: if no words meet the condition, return empty string.

So the code structure would be:

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n &lt; 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    words = sentence.split()
    result = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return &#39; &#39;.join(result)

Wait, but what if the input is an empty string? According to constraints, len(sentence) &gt;=1. So the split will return at least one word (but since the sentence is non-empty, but maybe consisting of a single word?), but even if the split results in empty strings? Well, according to the problem statement, the sentence contains only letters, so probably each word is non-empty. However, the split() method would split on multiple spaces, but the problem states that words are separated by space. So the input is properly formatted.

Testing the code with the examples.

For example 1:

sentence = &#34;This is a test&#34; → split into [&#39;This&#39;, &#39;is&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;test&#39;] → len 4, 2, 1, 4. Only &#39;is&#39; is kept. Joined gives &#39;is&#39;.

Another test case: input &#34;a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z&#34; → Each word is length 1. None are primes. So output is empty string.

Another test case: &#34;hello world&#34; → lengths 5 and 6. 5 is prime, 6 is not. So output is &#34;hello&#34;.

What about a word with length 2, like &#34;ab&#34;? It&#39;s prime. So if the sentence is &#34;ab cd ef&#34;, then lengths 2, 2, 2. All primes. Output is &#34;ab cd ef&#34;.

I think this covers everything. Now, implementing the code.
&lt;/think&gt;

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Returns a string containing words from the input sentence whose lengths are prime numbers,
    preserving their original order.
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    def is_prime(n):
        if n &lt; 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    words = sentence.split()
    result = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return &#39; &#39;.join(result)</pre>

Yes, that should work. Let me test against examples.

Sample 1: [1,2,3,4] and [1,2,3,4]. odd_count is 2, even_count is 2 → YES.

Sample 2: [1,2,3,4] and [1,5,3,4]. odd_count is 2, even_count is 1 → 2&gt;1 → NO.

Another test case: lst1 has 3 odds, lst2 has 3 evens → YES.

What if lst1 has 0 odds? Then even_count can be anything, since no need to exchange. So returns YES.

If lst1 has 1 odd, and lst2 has 0 evens → returns NO.

This logic seems correct. Thus, the code should be as above.
&lt;/think&gt;

def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    odd_count = sum(1 for x in lst1 if x % 2 != 0)
    even_count = sum(1 for x in lst2 if x % 2 == 0)

Testing this with the sample input &#39;three one five&#39; → [&#39;three&#39;, &#39;one&#39;, &#39;five&#39;] → converted to [3,1,5], sorted to [1,3,5], then back to &#39;one three five&#39;. Which matches the expected output.

I think this should work. Also, the code uses the correct types, and handles the conversion properly. No edge cases considered here, but according to the problem statement, inputs are valid. So this should handle all cases.

        digits.append(str(remainder))
        x = x // base
    digits.reverse()
    return &#39;&#39;.join(digits)

Wait, but what if the base is 1? Well, the problem states that base numbers are less than 10. But base 1 is invalid because there&#39;s no positional notation system with base 1. However, the problem says that base is less than 10, but does not state that it&#39;s ≥2. However, the examples use base 2, 3. So perhaps the function expects base to be ≥2. But the problem says &#34;base numbers are less than 10&#34;, which probably means that base is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Therefore, the function can safely assume that base is valid.

Therefore, the code should work.

Testing the code with the examples:

Sample 1: change_base(8,3) → &#39;22&#39; → yes.

Sample 2: change_base(8,2) → &#39;1000&#39; → yes.

Sample 3: change_base(7,2) → &#39;111&#39; → yes.

Edge case: x=0 → returns &#39;0&#39;.

Another edge case: x=1, base=2 → &#39;1&#39;.

Another case: x=5, base=5 → &#39;10&#39;.

Yes.

So the code seems correct.
&lt;/think&gt;

def change_base(x: int, base: int) -&gt; str:
    if x == 0:
        return &#39;0&#39;
    digits = []
    while x &gt; 0:
        remainder = x % base
        digits.append(str(remainder))
        x = x // base
    digits.reverse()
    return &#39;&#39;.join(digits)</pre>

    <div class="content">
    <pre>    return sorted(set(l))

Wait, but wait a second. Converting a list to a set loses the order, but since we&#39;re going to sort it anyway, maybe that&#39;s acceptable. However, there&#39;s a catch here. The order in which elements are added to the set isn&#39;t preserved, but since we&#39;re sorting the resulting set, the order of the original list doesn&#39;t matter. So the code would work as expected.

But let me check another example. Suppose the input list is [3, 2, 3, 1]. The set is {1,2,3}, sorted gives [1,2,3], which is correct.

Another case: empty list? If l is empty, then set(l) is empty, sorted returns empty list. Which is correct.

What about a list with one element? Like [4], then set is {4}, sorted is [4]. Correct.

But wait, there&#39;s a potential issue here. The set conversion may not preserve the order, but since we are sorting, it&#39;s irrelevant. So the code should work.

However, there&#39;s another approach. For example, using a loop to collect unique elements while maintaining order, but then sorting. But that&#39;s more complicated. The current approach is concise and efficient.

But wait, the problem says &#34;sorted unique elements&#34;. So the function must return a list sorted in increasing order. The code above does that.

Therefore, the implementation is simply returning the sorted version of the set of the input list.

But wait, the function&#39;s name is &#39;unique&#39;, but the code is converting to a set and then sorting. So the function is correctly named, as the output is the unique elements sorted.

Thus, the code should be:

def unique(l: list):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;Return sorted unique elements in a list&#34;&#34;&#34;
    return sorted(set(l))

But wait, let me check the example again. The sample input is [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], and the output is [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]. Using the code, set(l) would be {0,2,3,5,9,123}, sorted gives the same as the example. So yes, this works.

But wait, what if the list contains multiple elements, some of which are the same but in different positions? For example, [1, 2, 2, 3]. The set is {1,2,3}, sorted is [1,2,3], which is correct.

So this solution should work. Therefore, the code is as simple as that.
&lt;/think&gt;

def unique(l: list):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;Return sorted unique elements in a list
    &gt;&gt;&gt; unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]

    <pre>    return n % 2 == 0 and n &gt;= 8

Wait, but what about n=8? Let me check the example given. In the example, is_equal_to_sum_even(8) returns True. According to this code, yes.

But wait, let me make sure that there isn&#39;t any exception. For example, suppose n=8, which is allowed. Another example, n=10, which is allowed. What about n=2? No, because 2 is less than 8. So code correctly returns false.

This seems to cover all cases. However, let me think again. Are there any even numbers &gt;=8 that cannot be expressed as the sum of four even positive numbers?

Suppose n=8: 2+2+2+2=8 → yes.

n=10: 2+2+2+4=10 → yes.

n=12: 2+2+2+6=12 → yes.

n=14: 2+2+2+8=14 → yes.

Any even number &gt;=8 can be written as 2+2+2+(n-6). Since n is even, n-6 is even. Also, n-6 &gt;= 2 (since n &gt;=8 → n-6 &gt;= 2). Therefore, the fourth term is at least 2. Therefore, all terms are positive even numbers.

Therefore, the code is correct.

Thus, the solution is to check if n is even and &gt;=8.
&lt;/think&gt;

    # Convert to sorted list
    return sorted(common_set)

Wait, but the order matters here. Since the problem requires the output to be sorted, converting to a sorted list makes sense. The sorted() function will arrange them in ascending order, which is standard.

Testing the first example again: the common elements are 1,5,653. Sorted as [1,5,653], which is correct.

Yes, this should work. Let me check if there&#39;s any edge cases. What if one of the lists is empty? Then the intersection would be empty, and returning an empty list is correct.

What if there are no common elements? Then the function returns an empty list, which is right.

I think this solution covers all cases. The code is straightforward and uses built-in functions which are efficient. The use of sets ensures uniqueness and the intersection finds common elements. Sorting is done once at the end.

Therefore, the implementation should be as written.

def get_row(lst, x):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists,
    which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,
    each row may contain a different number of columns.
    Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list,
    and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that
    each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.
    Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.
    Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.
    
    Examples:
    get_row([
      [1,2,3,4,5,6],
      [1,2,3,4,1,6],
      [1,2,3,4,5,1]
    ], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
    get_row([], 1) == []
    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]

    <div class="content">
    <pre>    result = []
    for row_idx, row in enumerate(lst):
        for col_idx, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == x:
                result.append( (row_idx, col_idx) )
    # Now sort the result
    result.sort(key=lambda t: (t[0], -t[1]))
    return result

Wait, but the sample shows that in the first example, the order after collection is [(0,0), (1,0), (1,4), (2,5), (2,0)] and after sorting becomes [(0,0), (1,4), (1,0), (2,5), (2,0)]. Let&#39;s see:

When we apply the sort with key (row, -column), the tuples are:

(0,0): key (0, 0)

(1,0): key (1, 0)

(1,4): key (1, -4)

(2,5): key (2,-5)

(2,0): key (2, 0)

Comparing these keys:

(0,0) is first.

Between (1,0) and (1,-4): since 0 is greater than -4, (1,0) comes after (1,-4)? Wait no. Wait, the key is (row, -col). So for (1,0), the key is (1, -0) → (1, 0). For (1,4), the key is (1, -4). Comparing (1,0) vs (1,-4): since 0 is bigger than -4, (1,0) comes after (1,-4) in normal sorting. But we want the columns to be in descending order. So, for the same row, the columns should be sorted in descending order. Which means that for two entries in the same row, the one with higher column index comes first. 

But when we use the key (row, -col), the sort is done in ascending order. So, for two entries in the same row, their keys are (row, -col1) and (row, -col2). To have higher cols first, we need that when comparing, the entry with higher col comes first. Since -col is smaller for higher cols, the key (row, -col) would sort them in ascending order, meaning that entries with lower -col (higher actual col) come first. 

Yes, that&#39;s right. For example, if col1 is 4 and col2 is 0, then -col1 is -4, -col2 is 0. In ascending order, -4 comes before 0, so (row, -4) is considered smaller than (row, 0), so during sorting, (row, -4) comes first. Thus, the original (row, 4) would come before (row, 0), which is exactly what we want.

Therefore, the lambda function for the key is correct.

Testing the first sample, after appending all the tuples, the list is [(0,0), (1,0), (1,4), (2,5), (2,0)]. Applying the sort with key (t[0], -t[1]):

Each tuple&#39;s key is:

(0,0) → (0, 0)

(1,0) → (1, 0)

(1,4) → (1, -4)

(2,5) → (2, -5)

(2,0) → (2, 0)

When sorted, the order is determined by the keys. So the keys are:

(0,0) → first.

Next compare (1, -4) and (1, 0). Since -4 &lt; 0, (1, -4) comes before (1, 0). So the order between (1,4) and (1,0) is (1,4) first, then (1,0).

Similarly, (2, -5) comes before (2, 0). So the sorted list becomes [(0,0), (1,4), (1,0), (2,5), (2,0)], which matches the sample.

Looks good. What about other edge cases?

Test case 2: get_row([], 1) → [].

Test case 3: get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) → [(2,2)].

Yes, because the third row is [1,2,3]. The 3 is at index 2. So the tuple is (2,2), which is correctly added.

What about a row with multiple instances of x in different columns?

Like, if a row is [3, 1, 3], looking for x=3. The columns would be 0 and 2. So the tuples would be (row, 0) and (row, 2). Sorting by column descending would put (row, 2) first, then (row, 0). So the key (row, -2) and (row, -0) → (row, -2) is smaller than (row, 0), so yes, sorted properly.

Thus, the code seems correct.

I think that&#39;s all. Now write the code accordingly.
&lt;/think&gt;

    result = []

Testing the sample inputs.

Sample 1: cycpattern_check(&#34;abcd&#34;,&#34;abd&#34;) → False. The rotations of &#34;abd&#34; are &#34;abd&#34;, &#34;bd a&#34; (wait, let&#39;s compute):

For &#34;abd&#34;, length 3. Rotations:

i=0: abd
i=1: bd a → &#34;bda&#34;
i=2: d ab → &#34; dab&#34;? Wait, no. Wait, b is &#34;abd&#34;, so:

for i=0: b[0:] + b[:0] → &#34;abd&#34;+&#34;&#34;: &#34;abd&#34;

i=1: b[1:] is &#34;bd&#34;, plus b[:1] which is &#34;a&#34; → &#34;bd&#34;+&#34;a&#34; → &#34;bda&#34;

i=2: b[2:] is &#34;d&#34;, plus b[:2] which is &#34;ab&#34; → &#34;dab&#34;

Check if any of these (&#34;abd&#34;, &#34;bda&#34;, &#34;dab&#34;) are in &#34;abcd&#34;. Looking for substrings. &#34;abd&#34; is not in &#34;abcd&#34; (since &#34;abcd&#34; is a-b-c-d), but &#34;dab&#34; would require the letters d-a-b, but in &#34;abcd&#34; the order is a-b-c-d. So none of the rotations are present. Hence returns False. Which matches the sample.

Second sample: &#34;hello&#34;,&#34;ell&#34; → True. Rotations are &#34;ell&#34;, &#34;lle&#34;, &#34;lee&#34;. &#34;ell&#34; is in &#34;hello&#34; (the substring starts at index 1). So returns True.

Third sample: &#34;whassup&#34;,&#34;psus&#34; → False. Rotations of psus are:

length 4. So rotations:

i=0: psus

i=1: susp

i=2: usps

i=3: spus

Check if any of these are in &#34;whassup&#34;. Let&#39;s see:

Original string is w h a s s u p. Let&#39;s look for &#34;psus&#34;, &#34;sus p&#34;, etc. Does any of these appear? &#34;psus&#34; would be p-s-u-s. In &#34;whassup&#34;, the letters are ... s u p. So the end is s u p. So &#34;psus&#34; would need p followed by s, u, s. But the string ends with p. So probably not. All rotations may not be present, hence returns False.

Fourth sample: &#34;abab&#34;,&#34;baa&#34; → True. Rotations of &#34;baa&#34; are &#34;baa&#34;, &#34;aab&#34;, &#34;aba&#34;. Check if any of these are in &#34;abab&#34;. &#34;aba&#34; is present as the first three characters (a-b-a). Yes, so returns True.

Fifth sample: &#34;efef&#34;,&#34;eeff&#34; → False. Rotations of eeff are eeff, effe, ffee, fee e? Wait, let&#39;s calculate:

original string is &#34;eeff&#34;, length 4. Rotations:

i=0: eeff

i=1: efff? Wait no. Original is &#34;eeff&#34;. For i=1, it&#39;s b[1:] + b[:1]. b[1:] is &#34;eff&#34;, and b[:1] is &#34;e&#34;. So &#34;effe&#34;. Similarly, i=2: &#34;fefe&#34;, i=3: &#34;feef&#34;?

Wait, let me recheck:

Original b is &#34;eeff&#34;.

rotations:

i=0: &#34;eeff&#34;

i=1: &#34;effe&#34;

i=2: &#34;ffee&#34;

i=3: &#34;feef&#34;

Check if any of these are in &#34;efef&#34;.

Looking for substrings. The string &#34;efef&#34; is e-f-e-f. Now, the rotations are &#34;eeff&#34;, &#34;effe&#34;, &#34;ffee&#34;, &#34;feef&#34;.

None of these are substrings of &#34;efef&#34;. Because &#34;eeff&#34; is e-e-f-f, which isn&#39;t in efef. Similarly, others. So returns False.

Last sample: &#34;himenss&#34;,&#34;simen&#34; → True. The rotations of &#34;simen&#34; (length 5) are:

i=0: simen

i=1: imens

i=2: mense

i=3: sense

i=4: senim ?

Wait, let&#39;s do it properly. For &#34;simen&#34;:

rotation for i=0: simen

i=1:imen + s → imens?

Wait, the string is &#34;simen&#34;. For i=1, it&#39;s b[1:] + b[:1], which is &#34;imen&#34; + &#34;s&#34; → &#34;imens&#34;.

Similarly:

i=0: simen

i=1: imens

i=2: mense

i=3: ensim

i=4: nsimi ?

Wait, maybe I&#39;m making a mistake here. Let me think again. The original string is &#34;simen&#34;, which is s-i-m-e-n.

For i=0: s+i+m+e+n → simen.

i=1: i+m+e+n+s → imens.

i=2: m+e+n+s+i → mense.

i=3: e+n+s+i+m → ensim.

i=4: n+s+i+m+e → nsime?

Wait, perhaps I made an error here. Anyway, regardless of exact rotations, the correct rotation for i=3 would be the string shifted left by 3 positions. So for &#34;simen&#34;, rotating once gives &#34;imen s&#34;, twice gives &#34;mene s&#34;, etc. But regardless, the point is that one of these rotations must be a substring of &#34;himenss&#34;.

In the sample, the expected output is True. Let&#39;s see. The string &#34;himenss&#34; contains &#34;simen&#34; as a substring? Or one of the rotations. Let&#39;s see:

&#34;h i m e n s s&#34;. The substring &#34;simen&#34; would start at position 2: m e n s s... Hmm, no. Wait, maybe &#34;h i m e n s s&#34;. Let&#39;s look for &#34;simen&#34;. The letters s i m e n — does that exist? Let&#39;s see:

At position 1: i m e n s — no. Maybe another rotation. For instance, &#34;ensim&#34; (from i=3)? Let&#39;s see: the string is himenss. Let&#39;s look for &#34;ensim&#34;. The letters e n s i m — in the string, after &#39;h&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;m&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;n&#39;, &#39;s&#39;, &#39;s&#39;. So the sequence e n s i m is not present. Alternatively, maybe &#34;senim&#34; (if that&#39;s a rotation)?

Alternatively, maybe the rotation is &#34;mensim&#34;? Not sure. Perhaps the actual correct rotation is &#34;simen&#34; itself. But in the original string &#34;himenss&#34;, does &#34;simen&#34; occur as a substring? Let&#39;s see:

Breaking down &#34;himenss&#34;: h, i, m, e, n, s, s. The substring starting at index 1 is i, m, e, n, s — that&#39;s imens. Not simen. Starting at index 2: m,e,n,s,s — ments. Not matching. How about other rotations?

Maybe the rotation is &#34;menis&#34;? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe &#34;simen&#34; is not present, but one of the rotations is. For example, the rotation &#34;imens&#34; (i=1): i,m,e,n,s. That&#39;s in the string as the substring starting at index 1. So &#34;imens&#34; is present in &#34;himenss&#34;? Let&#39;s check: the string is h i m e n s s. From index 1 to 5: i m e n s — that&#39;s &#34;imens&#34;, which is indeed a substring. So the function would return True.

Therefore, the code seems correct.

Thus, the implementation is as outlined. The code generates all rotations and checks each one.

    for rot in rotations:
        if rot in a:
            return True
    return False</pre>

Testing against the examples.

First example: [], [] → totals 0 and 0 → return lst1, which is correct.

Second example: [&#39;hi&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;] → 2+5=7; [&#39;hI&#39;, &#39;Hi&#39;] → 2+2=4. Since 7&gt;4, return lst2. Which matches the sample.

Third example: [&#39;hi&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;] (7) vs [&#39;hi&#39;, &#39;hi&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;, &#39;project&#39;] → 2+2+5+8=17. 7 &lt;17 → return lst1. Correct.

Fourth example: [&#39;hi&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;] (7) vs [&#39;hI&#39;, &#39;hi&#39;, &#39;hi&#39;] → 2 + 2 + 2 =6. 7 &gt;6 → return lst2. Which matches the sample.

Looks like this code handles all cases correctly. So the implementation seems solid.

        current = a + b + c + d
        a, b, c, d = b, c, d, current
    
    return d

Testing this function with the samples:

Test case 1: fib4(5)

Steps:

Initially, a=0, b=0, c=2, d=0.

range(4,5+1) is 4 to 5, so two iterations.

First iteration (i=4):

current = 0+0+2+0 = 2.

a becomes 0, b becomes 2, c becomes 0, d becomes 2.

Second iteration (i=5):

current = 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 =4.

a becomes 2, b becomes 0, c becomes 2, d becomes4.

return d=4. Correct.

Another test case: fib4(6):

After processing i=5, the variables are a=2, b=0, c=2, d=4.

Next iteration (i=6):

current = 2 + 0 + 2 +4 =8.

Variables become a=0, b=2, c=4, d=8. Return 8. Correct.

Third test case: fib4(7):

Processing i=6, variables are a=0, b=2, c=4, d=8.

current = 0+2+4+8 =14. Variables become a=2, b=4, c=8, d=14. Return 14. Correct.

Looks good.

Edge cases: n=0 returns 0, n=1 returns 0, etc.

What about n=4? It should return 2. Let&#39;s see:

loop runs once (range(4,4+1) is 4 to 4, so one iteration.)

current is 0+0+2+0=2. a becomes 0, b becomes 0, c becomes 2, d becomes 2. return d=2. Correct.

So this implementation should work correctly.
&lt;/think&gt;

    <pre>    vowels = {&#39;a&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;u&#39;}
    return &#39;&#39;.join([c for c in text if c.lower() not in vowels])

Wait, let&#39;s test this with some cases.

Test case 1: empty string → returns empty. Correct.

Test case 2: &#34;abcdef\nghijklm&#34; → the vowels are a, e, and possibly others? Wait, the input is &#34;abcdef\nghijklm&#34;. Let&#39;s break it down:

Original text: a b c d e f \n g h i j k l m

Vowels are a, e, i. So after removal, the result should be bcdf\nghjklm. Let&#39;s see:

The code would process each character:

For &#39;a&#39;: lowercase is &#39;a&#39; which is in vowels → excluded.

&#39;b&#39; → not a vowel → included.

&#39;c&#39; → included.

&#39;d&#39; → included.

&#39;e&#39; → excluded.

&#39;f&#39; → included.

&#39;\n&#39; → not a vowel → included.

Then &#39;g&#39; → included.

&#39;h&#39; → included.

&#39;i&#39; → excluded.

&#39;j&#39; → included.

&#39;k&#39; → included.

&#39;l&#39; → included.

&#39;m&#39; → included.

So the result is &#39;bcdf\nghjklm&#39;, which matches the expected output. So that works.

Another test case: &#39;abcdef&#39; → removes a, e → gives &#39;bcdf&#39;.

Test case &#39;aaaaa&#39; → all vowels, so returns &#39;&#39;.

Test case &#39;aaBAA&#39; → converts to lowercase, checks each character. The &#39;a&#39;s are vowels, but the &#39;B&#39; is not. So the result is &#39;B&#39;.

Another test case &#39;zbcd&#39; → none of the letters are vowels, so returns same as input.

Yes, this seems correct.

So the code would be as written above. However, perhaps using a generator expression inside the join is efficient enough.

Therefore, the implementation should be straightforward. Now, I just need to write the function according to the given specifications.

    hash_obj.update(text.encode(&#39;utf-8&#39;))
    return hash_obj.hexdigest()

Wait, but the example given is &#39;Hello world&#39; which should produce &#39;3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62&#39;. Let me test that. Let&#39;s see, if I run that code with &#39;Hello world&#39;, does it return that hash?

Yes, because the MD5 of &#39;Hello world&#39; is indeed that value. So that should work.

But wait, what if the input is not a string? Well, according to the problem statement, the function is given a string &#39;text&#39;, so perhaps we can assume that the input is a string. The problem says that if the text is an empty string, return None. So the function is supposed to handle strings, and the example uses a string.

Therefore, the code seems correct. Also, the docstring includes the example, which the code should satisfy.

Another thing: the function is case-sensitive? Well, the example uses &#39;Hello world&#39; with a capital H and lowercase letters. The MD5 hash is case-insensitive in terms of the output, but the input string&#39;s case affects the hash. So the code handles that correctly.

I think that&#39;s all. So the code should be as written.
&lt;/think&gt;

def max_fill(grid, capacity):

    You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,
    and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
    Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, 
    and all buckets have the same capacity.

    <pre>    import math
    total = 0
    for row in grid:
        sum_row = sum(row)
        total += (sum_row + capacity - 1) // capacity
    return total

Wait, but why does the function import math? Because in the docstring, they imported math. However, in our code, we don&#39;t actually need math. The calculation can be done without it. So perhaps that import is redundant. But according to the problem statement, the function signature includes importing math. However, in reality, the code doesn&#39;t need it. But since the user provided that line in the function, maybe they want us to include it. But in practice, the code would work without it. However, the user may have included it for some reason. But in our case, the code is correct either way.

But the original code starts with &#34;import math&#34;, but in the actual implementation, we don&#39;t need it. However, the user&#39;s code may have that line, but perhaps it&#39;s just part of the docstring. Wait, looking back at the user&#39;s input:

They said:

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    ...
    &#34;&#34;&#34;

So the code starts with importing math. But in our solution, we don&#39;t need to use math. However, the code as written would import math, but in our solution, we can ignore that. But perhaps the user wants us to keep that line?

But in reality, the code would run correctly even if that line is present. However, in the code that we&#39;re writing, we can leave that line. Or perhaps the user made a mistake in including that line. But regardless, the code must follow the function signature exactly. Therefore, the code must start with import math. Even though it&#39;s not needed, but the user included it in their function definition. So we need to include that line.

Therefore, the code is:

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    total = 0
    for row in grid:
        sum_row = sum(row)
        total += (sum_row + capacity - 1) // capacity
    return total

But wait, the initial code in the problem had the import inside the function. But in Python, importing inside a function is allowed, although it&#39;s generally better practice to import at the top. However, the user&#39;s code includes that line, so we have to replicate it.

However, in the code above, the import math is inside the function. But in Python, that&#39;s allowed. So the code is valid.

Thus, the final code is as written.
&lt;/think&gt;

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    total = 0
    for row in grid:
        sum_row = sum(row)
        total += (sum_row + capacity - 1) // capacity
    return total</pre>

    <div class="content">
    <pre>    return None
else:
    return max(strings, key=len)

But wait, let me test this logic against the examples given.

In the third example, [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;bb&#39;, &#39;ccc&#39;], the max len is 3, so &#39;ccc&#39; is returned. That works.

For the second example, [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;], all have length 1. So max returns the first one, which is &#39;a&#39;. Correct.

What about if the list is empty? Then return None. That&#39;s covered.

But wait, what if the list has one element? Then it just returns that element. Which is correct.

So the code seems straightforward. Let me make sure that the function is properly handling all cases.

Another test case: longest([&#39;aa&#39;, &#39;aaa&#39;, &#39;aaaa&#39;]). The max is &#39;aaaa&#39;, which is correct.

Another case: longest([&#39;abc&#39;, &#39;def&#39;, &#39;ghij&#39;]) → &#39;ghij&#39; since it&#39;s the first with length 4.

Yes, the max function with key=len should work here because it returns the first occurrence in case of ties.

Therefore, the implementation is simple. Now, writing the code according to the function signature.

The function is supposed to be named &#39;longest&#39; and take a list of str, return optional str.

So the code would be:

def longest(strings: List[str]) -&gt; Optional[str]:
    if not strings:
        return None
    return max(strings, key=len)

That&#39;s it. Let me check the sample tests.

Sample 1: longest([]) → None. Correct.

Sample 2: longest([&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;]) → &#39;a&#39;. Since all are same length, first is returned. Correct.

Sample 3: longest([&#39;a&#39;,&#39;bb&#39;,&#39;ccc&#39;]) → &#39;ccc&#39;. Correct.

Looks like this code should work.
&lt;/think&gt;

def longest(strings: List[str]) -&gt; Optional[str]:
    if not strings:
        return None
    return max(strings, key=len)</pre>

Wait, but what about numbers that are not int nor float? According to the problem statement, the input list consists of numbers, but perhaps in reality, the function may encounter other types. However, the problem says to ignore numbers that are not integers. So, for example, if the list contains a string, it&#39;s ignored. But according to the problem&#39;s docstring, the input is a list of numbers, so perhaps we can assume that all elements are either int or float.

Testing this code against the examples.

Test case 1: [1,3,2,0]

As discussed earlier, returns 10 → correct.

Test case 2: [-1,-2,0] → returns 0 → correct.

Test case 3: [9,-2] → returns 81 → correct.

Test case 4: [0] → returns 0 → correct.

Another test case: [3.0, 2.5, -4.0, 5.0] → sum is 9 + 25 = 34 → code returns 34.

Another test case: [2.0, 3.0] → 2.0 is even, 3.0 is odd → sum is 9 → correct.

Edge case: empty list → returns 0 → correct.

Another case: [ -3.0 ] → negative → 0.

Another case: [ 4.0, 5.0 ] → 5.0 is odd → 25 added.

Looks good.

I think this code handles all the required scenarios.

    sum_squares = 0
    for num in lst:
        if isinstance(num, int):

def get_odd_collatz(n):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Note: 
        1. Collatz(1) is [1].
        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

    For example:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.

    <pre>    if current % 2 == 1:
        odds.append(current)
    if current % 2 == 0:
        current = current // 2
    else:
        current = current * 3 + 1
if 1 not in odds:
    odds.append(1)

Wait, but 1 is always odd. So in the case where the loop exited because current is 1, we need to add 1 to the list. But in cases where the loop didn&#39;t run (n=1), we also need to add 1.

But wait, in the first case, when the loop runs, say for n=5, the loop runs until current is 1. But when current is 1, the loop breaks. So after the loop, we need to add 1 to the list. Because in the loop, the current is checked, but when current is 1, the loop doesn&#39;t process it. So in that case, the 1 is not added unless we manually add it.

So the code after the loop should add 1 to the list. But wait, in the case where n is 1, the loop never runs. So the list is empty. Adding 1 to the list gives [1], which is correct.

In the case where n=5, the loop runs until current becomes 1. Then, after the loop, we add 1 to the list. So the list becomes [5,1]. Then we sort it, giving [1,5].

Yes, that seems correct.

Another test case: n=3.

Collatz sequence: 3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1.

Odd numbers: 3,5,1.

So the list after the loop would be [3,5], then adding 1 gives [3,5,1]. Sorted is [1,3,5].

Which is correct.

Another test case: n=2.

Sequence: 2 → 1. So during the loop, current is 2 (even). The loop runs once, checks if current is odd (no), computes next current as 1. Then loop ends. Add 1. So the list is [1]. Sorted is [1].

Another case: n=7.

Sequence: 7 → 22 → 11 → 34 → 17 → 52 → 26 → 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1.

The odd numbers are 7, 11, 17, 13, 5. Also, 1 is added. So the list after loop is [7,11,17,13,5], then adding 1 makes [7,11,17,13,5,1]. Sorting gives [1,5,7,11,13,17].

So the code logic works.

So now, implementing this in Python.

Function definition:

def get_odd_collatz(n):

    odds = []
    current = n
    while current != 1:
        if current % 2 == 1:
            odds.append(current)
        if current % 2 == 0:
            current = current // 2
        else:
            current = current * 3 + 1
    # After loop, add 1 if not already present
    # But since 1 is always odd, and the loop stopped when current is 1, we need to add it
    # However, if the original n was 1, then the loop didn&#39;t run, and odds is empty.
    # So in either case, we need to add 1.
    # Wait, but in the case where the loop ran, and current became 1, but during the loop, the code didn&#39;t check for 1. So after the loop, we need to add 1.
    # But in the case where the loop didn&#39;t run (n=1), we need to add 1.
    # So regardless, after the loop, we add 1 to the list.
    # Wait, but what if 1 was already in the list? Like if n=1, then after adding 1, the list is [1]. That&#39;s correct.
    # But for example, if n=5, during the loop, the code appends 5. Then after the loop, adds 1. So the list is [5,1]. Correct.

    # So in code, after the loop, we append 1 to the list.

    # Wait, but what if the loop processed 1? No, because the loop stops when current is 1. So the code inside the loop is executed only when current is not 1. So after the loop, current is 1. So we need to add 1 to the list.

    # However, in the case where the initial n is 1, the loop is skipped, and the list is empty. So appending 1 gives [1], which is correct.

    # So the code is:

    odds.append(1)

    # But wait, what if 1 is already in the list? For example, if n=1, then after appending 1, the list is [1]. Which is correct. If n=5, the list was [5], then append 1, making [5,1]. Then sorted.

    # So the code after the loop is:

    odds.append(1)

    # But wait, what if the initial n is 1? Then the loop doesn&#39;t run, and odds is empty. Appending 1 gives [1], which is correct.

    # But what if the initial n is 3? During the loop, current is 3 (odd, added to list). Then current becomes 10, then 5 (added?), then 16, etc. Until current is 1. Then after the loop, append 1. So the list is [3,5, ... ] and then 1 added. So the list includes 1.

    # However, in the case where the loop runs, and current becomes 1, but during the loop, the code may have already added 1? No, because the loop runs while current is not 1. So when current is 1, the loop stops. So the code inside the loop is not executed for current=1. Hence, after the loop, we need to add 1.

    # So in code, after the loop, append 1.

    # Wait, but in the example where n=5, the code appends 5, then after the loop, appends 1. So the list is [5,1]. Then sorted.

    # So the code is:

    # Append 1 after the loop.

    # But wait, in the case where the initial n is 1, the loop is not entered. So the list is empty. Then after the loop, append 1. So the list becomes [1], which is correct.

    # So the code is:

    odds.append(1)

    # But then, what if the initial n is 1? Then the list is [1], which is correct.

    # However, in some scenarios, 1 could have been added earlier. For example, if n=3, during the loop, the current becomes 1, but the loop stops. Then after the loop, we append 1 again. But in that case, the list would have 3, 5, 1 (from the loop?) Wait no. Let&#39;s see:

For n=3:

Initial current is 3. Enter loop.

Check if current is odd (yes): add to list → [3]

Compute next current: 3*3+1=10.

Loop again: current is 10 (even). Compute next as 5.

Loop again: current is 5 (odd). Add to list → [3,5].

Next current is 5*3+1=16.

Loop again: current is 16 (even). Next is 8.

Current is 8 → next 4 → next 2 → next 1.

Now current is 1. Exit loop. Append 1 → list becomes [3,5,1]. Then sorted → [1,3,5].

Which is correct.

So the code correctly appends 1 even though it was already part of the sequence. But in reality, the 1 is added once. So the code is okay.

But wait, in the case where the initial n is 1, the list is empty, then we append 1. So that&#39;s correct.

However, another thing to consider: when the loop is running, the current is updated. So for example, if n is 5, the loop runs until current becomes 1. Then after the loop, append 1. So the list contains 5 and 1. Which is correct.

So the code for the function would be:

def get_odd_collatz(n):
    odds = []
    current = n
    while current != 1:
        if current % 2 == 1:
            odds.append(current)
        if current % 2 == 0:
            current = current // 2
        else:
            current = current * 3 + 1
    odds.append(1)
    return sorted(odds)

Wait, but in the example given, for n=5, the list after the loop is [5], then append 1 → [5,1], sorted gives [1,5], which matches the sample.

Testing n=1: the loop doesn&#39;t run, append 1 → [1], sorted is [1], correct.

Testing n=3: the loop adds 3, then 5. Then append 1 → [3,5,1], sorted → [1,3,5].

Yes.

But wait, in the code, the line &#39;odds.append(1)&#39; is done after the loop. What if the initial n is 1? Then the loop is not entered, and the code appends 1. So that&#39;s correct.

What about when the loop runs and current becomes 1, but 1 is already in the list? For example, if n=5, the list is [5], then append 1 → [5,1]. Then sorted. So that&#39;s correct.

But what if during the loop, the current becomes 1, but the code adds it again? No, because the loop stops when current is 1. So the code inside the loop is not executed for current=1. So the code appends 1 once.

But in the case where the initial n is 1, the code appends 1 once. All good.

So this code should work.

But wait, let me think again. In the loop, current is checked against 1. So when current is 1, the loop stops. So during the loop, the code adds the current to the list only if it&#39;s odd. But when current is 1, the loop doesn&#39;t run. So after the loop, the code appends 1 to the list. This ensures that 1 is included in the list.

But what if the initial n is 1? Then the loop is not entered, and the list is empty. Then, after the loop, append 1. So the list is [1], which is correct.

Another test case: n=2. The loop runs once. current is 2 (even). So the code skips adding anything. Then current is set to 1. Loop ends. Append 1 → list is [1]. Sorted is [1], which is correct.

Another test case: n=7. As discussed earlier, the code collects 7, 11, 17, 13, 5, then appends 1. So sorted list is [1,5,7,11,13,17].

Yes.

Thus, the code seems correct.
&lt;/think&gt;

    <div class="content">
    <pre>    return 0
else:
    product = 1
    for d in digits:
        product *=d
    return product

That seems correct. Let me test with the examples.

Example 1: n=1. The digits list is [1], product is 1. Correct.

Example 2: n=4. digits list is empty, return 0. Correct.

Example 3: n=235. digits are 2,3,5. The odd ones are 3 and 5. Product is 15. Correct.

Another test case: n=2468. All even, return 0. n=13579: product is 1*3*5*7*9 = 945.

What about n=0? Well, the problem states that n is a positive integer, so 0 isn&#39;t considered. So the function can assume n is positive.

Now, implementing this in Python.

The function would look like:

def digits(n):
    odds = []
    for c in str(n):
        d = int(c)
        if d % 2 != 0:
            odds.append(d)
    if not odds:
        return 0
    product = 1
    for num in odds:
        product *= num
    return product

Alternatively, using list comprehensions:

def digits(n):
    odds = [int(c) for c in str(n) if int(c) % 2 != 0]
    return 0 if not odds else product(odds)

Wait, but how to calculate the product. Oh right, we can use math.prod, but maybe the user expects us to compute it manually. Or maybe it&#39;s allowed. However, in some programming environments, math.prod may not be available. But since the problem doesn&#39;t specify, perhaps it&#39;s safe to use it. Alternatively, compute the product manually.

But for code correctness, let&#39;s do it manually. So the code above is okay.

Testing again:

For n=235, odds is [3,5]. product is 15. Correct.

Yes, that should work. So the code is as written.
&lt;/think&gt;

def digits(n):
    odds = [int(c) for c in str(n) if int(c) % 2 != 0]
    if not odds:
        return 0
    product = 1
    for num in odds:
        product *= num
    return product</pre>

def compare(game,guess):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
    definitely worth noting down and comparing.
    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.
    
    
    example:

    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -&gt; [0,0,0,0,3,3]
    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -&gt; [4,4,1,0,0,6]

Wait, zip will pair elements from game and guess. Then for each pair, compute the absolute difference. That&#39;s concise and efficient.

Testing with the examples:

First example: game is [1,2,3,4,5,1], guess is [1,2,3,4,2,-2]. Zip pairs them as (1,1), (2,2), etc. The differences are 0,0,0,0,3,3. Which matches the expected output.

Second example: game [0,5,0,0,0,4], guess [4,1,1,0,0,-2]. The differences are 4,4,1,0,0,6. Which matches.

So this code should work. Let me make sure there are no edge cases. What if the lists are empty? Well, the problem says they are of equal length, but the code would handle that. Also, negative numbers are allowed, but since we take absolute value, it&#39;s okay.

Yes, this should be the correct implementation.

But wait, the function&#39;s return type is specified as bool. The examples show that for empty string, it returns True, which is a boolean. So yes, that&#39;s correct.

Testing the examples:

is_palindrome(&#39;&#39;) → &#39;&#39; == &#39;&#39; → True. Correct.

is_palindrome(&#39;aba&#39;) → &#39;aba&#39; == &#39;aba&#39; → True. Correct.

is_palindrome(&#39;aaaaa&#39;) → same. True.

is_palindrome(&#39;zbcd&#39;) → &#39;zbcd&#39; vs &#39;dc bz&#39;? Wait, &#39;zbcd&#39; reversed is &#39;dc bz&#39;? Wait, let me see: original is &#39;z&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;,&#39;d&#39;. Reversed is &#39;d&#39;,&#39;c&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;z&#39; → &#39;dc bz&#39;? No, the actual reversed string is &#39;dc bz&#39;? Wait, no. The original string is &#39;zbcd&#39;, which is z b c d. Reverse is d c b z → &#39;dc bz&#39;? Wait, no, the reversed string is &#39;dc bz&#39;? Or &#39;dcbz&#39;? Oh right, the reversed string is &#39;dcbz&#39;, which is not equal to &#39;zbcd&#39;, so returns False. Which matches the example.

So the code works for those cases.

Therefore, the function can be written as above.

Testing some examples:

Another test case: n=4. A is 1000, B is 9*100=900, C is 100. Total is 1000 +900 -100 = 1800.

What&#39;s the actual count? Numbers starting with 1: 1000-1999 → 1000 numbers. Numbers ending with 1: first digit 1-9, second and third digits arbitrary, fourth is 1. So 9*10*10 = 900. Overlap is numbers starting and ending with 1: first digit 1, last digit 1, middle two digits arbitrary → 100 numbers. So total 1000 +900 -100= 1800. Correct.

    if is_balanced(s1 + s2) or is_balanced(s2 + s1):
        return &#39;Yes&#39;
    else:
        return &#39;No&#39;

Wait, but what if the list has more than two elements? No, the problem states that the input is a list of two strings. So the code can safely assume that.

Testing the first example:

[&#39;()(&#39;, &#39;)&#39;] → s1 is &#34;()(&#34;, s2 is &#34;)&#34;.

Checking s1+s2: &#34;()()&#34; → which is balanced. So the first condition is true, returns &#39;Yes&#39;.

Second example: [&#39;)&#39;, &#39;)&#39;] → s1 + s2 is &#34;))&#34;, which fails. s2 + s1 is same, also fails. Returns &#39;No&#39;.

What about cases where one of the strings is already balanced on its own, but when combined with the other, they may not be?

Like, suppose s1 is &#34;(()&#34;, s2 is &#34;)&#34;. Then s1 + s2 is &#34;(() )&#34;, which is &#34;(() )&#34;, which would have balance after each step:

( → 1, ( → 2, ) → 1, ) → 0. So that&#39;s balanced. So the code would return &#39;Yes&#39;.

Another case: s1 is &#34;)&#34;, s2 is &#34;(()&#34;. Then s2 + s1 is &#34;(() )&#34; → which is &#34;(() )&#34;, which is balanced. So the code would return &#39;Yes&#39;.

But what if s1 is &#34;(((&#34;, s2 is &#34;)))&#34;. Then s1 + s2 is &#34;((( )))&#34;, which would have balance going down to -1 at some points. So the code checks that and returns false. Similarly for s2 + s1. So returns &#39;No&#39;.

This seems correct.

I think this code should handle all cases correctly.
&lt;/think&gt;

    def is_balanced(s):
        balance = 0

Wait, but for the case where len(array) is 1, returning array[:] makes a copy. But in Python, if the input is a list, then array[:] creates a shallow copy. However, since the elements are integers, it&#39;s safe. So this should work.

Alternatively, for the case where len(array) is 1, return [array[0]], which is also a copy.

But in the code above, for len(array) &lt;=1, return array[:]. That works for both empty and single-element cases.

Let me check the sample inputs.

Sample input [5]: array is [5], len is 1. return array[:] → [5], correct.

Sample input []: return [], correct.

Yes.

    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5)+1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

Then, in the prime_length function, get len(string), pass it to is_prime, and return the result.

Wait, but what about when the string is empty? Its length is 0, which isn&#39;t prime. So the function would return False.

Testing examples:

prime_length(&#39;Hello&#39;) → &#39;Hello&#39; has 5 letters. 5 is prime → True. Correct.

prime_length(&#39;abcdcba&#39;) → length is 7, which is prime → True. Correct.

prime_length(&#39;kittens&#39;) → length is 7 (k-i-t-t-e-n-s?), let me count: k(1), i(2), t(3), t(4), e(5), n(6), s(7). Yes, 7 → True.

prime_length(&#39;orange&#39;) → length is 6. 6 is not prime (divisible by 2 and 3) → False. Correct.

So the code seems solid.

Now, putting it all together. The function prime_length will call this helper function.

But since the problem says to implement the function, maybe I can inline the prime check instead of using a separate helper function. But perhaps it&#39;s better to have a helper function for clarity. However, the user might want the entire code in one function.

Alternatively, handle the prime check directly inside the prime_length function.

So, the code structure would be:

def prime_length(string):
    # calculate length
    length = len(string)
    # check if length is prime
    if length &lt; 2:
        return False
    if length == 2:
        return True
    if length % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(length**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if length % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

Yes, that should work. Let me test some edge cases.

Test case where length is 1: returns False. Correct.

Length 2: returns True. Correct.

Length 3: check 3. The loop runs from 3 to sqrt(3)=~1.7, so the loop doesn&#39;t run. Returns True. Correct.

Length 4: even, returns False. Correct.

Length 9: check 3. 9%3==0 → returns False. Correct.

What about length 25? sqrt(25) is 5. So check 3 and 5. 25%3 is 1, 25%5 is 0 → returns False. Correct.

This seems to cover all cases.

Therefore, the code should be implemented as such.
&lt;/think&gt;

def prime_length(string):
    length = len(string)
    if length &lt; 2:
        return False
    if length == 2:
        return True
    if length % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(length ** 0.5) + 1, 2):

    <pre>    return number % 1

Wait, but why use math.floor()? Because for positive numbers, the integer part is the floor. But using modulus is easier and works here. Let me think again. For example, 3.5 - math.floor(3.5) equals 0.5. Alternatively, 3.5 % 1 is also 0.5. Both methods work. Which is better?

Well, the modulus approach is more direct and concise. So the function can just return number % 1. But perhaps the problem expects us to use math.floor? Let me look back at the problem statement.

The problem says that the integer part is the largest integer smaller than the given number. So for 3.5, it&#39;s 3. So the decimal part is number minus integer_part. So, integer_part = math.floor(number), then decimal = number - integer_part.

But for positive numbers, math.floor(number) is equivalent to int(number), but wait, no. Wait, for example, 3.5, math.floor(3.5) is 3.0. But if the number is 3.999, math.floor gives 3.0. So, using math.floor is safe.

However, using number % 1 is even simpler. Let me check with some examples.

If number is 3.5, 3.5 % 1 is 0.5. Correct.

If number is 4.0, 4.0%1 is 0.0. Correct.

If number is 2.999, 2.999%1 is 0.999. Correct.

So, the modulus method works. Therefore, the function can be written as returning number % 1.

But wait, what about when the number is zero? Like 0.0? Then the decimal part is 0.0. Which is correct.

Another thing: the problem says the input is a positive floating point number. So we don&#39;t have to worry about negative numbers. So the modulus approach is valid.

Thus, the code is simple: return number % 1.

But let me make sure that the function is correctly handling all cases. Let&#39;s test with the sample input.

Sample input: 3.5 → 3.5 % 1 = 0.5 → correct.

Another test case: 10.0 → 0.0. Correct.

Another test case: 0.1 → 0.1. Correct.

Yes, this seems to work. So the function can be implemented as such.
&lt;/think&gt;

    <pre>    while n &gt; 0:
        digit = n % 10
        if digit % 2 == 0:
            return True
        n = n // 10
    return False

Yes, this would work. Because for each digit, we check if it&#39;s even. If any is found, return True. Otherwise, after checking all digits, return False.

But wait, what about numbers like 0? Well, according to the problem statement, the input is a list of positive integers. So 0 isn&#39;t in the input. So no problem there.

Once we have this helper function, the main function can proceed as follows:

Initialize an empty list for results.

Loop through each num in x:

   if not has_even_digit(num):

       add to the result list.

Then, sort the result list and return it.

But wait, the examples show that the output is sorted. For instance, the first example returns [1, 15, 33], which is sorted. So after collecting all qualifying numbers, we need to sort them in increasing order.

So putting it all together.

Now, let&#39;s code this.

The function unique_digits will take x as input.

Implementing the helper function inside unique_digits might be possible, but perhaps better to inline it for efficiency, though in Python, functions are allowed.

Alternatively, within the loop, for each number, check each digit.

Another approach: Convert the number to a string, iterate through each character, check if any is even. For example:

for num in x:

    s = str(num)

    for ch in s:

        if int(ch) % 2 == 0:

            has_even = True

            break

    if not has_even:

        append to result.

This could be another way. Which is more efficient? Probably similar, but converting to string may be easier to read.

But for the purpose of coding, either approach is fine.

So, let&#39;s code this.

In the unique_digits function:

result = []

for num in x:

    # Check if any digit is even

    has_even = False

    temp = num

    while temp &gt; 0:

        digit = temp % 10

        if digit % 2 == 0:

            has_even = True

            break

        temp = temp // 10

    if not has_even:

        result.append(num)

Then, sort the result list.

return sorted(result)

Wait, but what about numbers like 0? Well, per problem statement, inputs are positive integers, so 0 is not present. So no issue.

Testing with sample input:

Sample 1: [15, 33, 1422, 1]

Check each number:

15: digits 1 and 5 → both odd → include.

33: same → include.

1422: digits 1,4,2,2 → 4,2,2 are even → exclude.

1: digit 1 → include.

Result list is [15, 33, 1]. Sorted gives [1,15,33] → matches the example.

Second sample input: [152, 323, 1422, 10]

Check each:

152 → digits 1,5,2 → 2 is even → exclude.

323 → digits 3,2,3 → 2 is even → exclude.

1422 → already checked, exclude.

10 → digits 1 and 0 → 0 is even → exclude.

So result is empty list → correct.

Thus, the code seems to handle these cases.

Now, code-wise, the function would look like:

def unique_digits(x):
    result = []
    for num in x:
        has_even = False
        temp = num
        while temp &gt; 0:
            digit = temp % 10
            if digit % 2 == 0:
                has_even = True
                break
            temp = temp // 10
        if not has_even:
            result.append(num)
    return sorted(result)

That&#39;s the code. Now, testing edge cases.

What if a number is 0? According to the note, the input is positive integers, so 0 is not in x. So no problem.

Another case: [2, 4, 6, 8] → all even digits → returns empty list.

Another case: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] → all odd digits → returns sorted list [1,3,5,7,9].

Another case: [123, 456, 789] → 123 has 2 (even?), yes. Wait 123: digits 1, 2, 3. 2 is even → excluded. 456 has 4,5,6 → 4 and 6 even. 789: 7,8,9 → 8 even. So all excluded. Result is empty.

Another case: [13579] → all odd digits → returned as [13579].

So the code seems to handle those.

Therefore, this implementation should work.
&lt;/think&gt;

def unique_digits(x):
    result = []
    for num in x:
        has_even = False
        temp = num
        while temp &gt; 0:
            digit = temp % 10
            if digit % 2 == 0:
                has_even = True
                break
            temp = temp // 10
        if not has_even:
            result.append(num)
    return sorted(result)</pre>

Or alternatively, using the swapcase method.

Which one is better? Well, the problem says to &#34;fully implement the function&#34;. If the user expects the use of built-in functions, then swapcase is the right choice. Otherwise, the list comprehension approach is manual.

Looking back at the example, when the input is &#39;Hello&#39;, the output is &#39;hELLO&#39;. Let&#39;s test both approaches.

Using swapcase: &#39;Hello&#39;.swapcase() gives &#39;hELLO&#39;, which matches the example. So that works.

Therefore, the function can be written as simply returning the swapcase of the input string.

But maybe the user wants the manual implementation. However, since the problem didn&#39;t mention avoiding built-ins, using swapcase is appropriate.

Thus, the code would be:

def flip_case(string: str) -&gt; str:
    return string.swapcase()

But I need to confirm that this meets the requirements. The docstring says that the function flips lowercase to uppercase and vice versa, which is exactly what swapcase does. Therefore, this should be the correct solution.
&lt;/think&gt;

def flip_case(string: str) -&gt; str:
    &#34;&#34;&#34; For a given string, flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase.
    &gt;&gt;&gt; flip_case(&#39;Hello&#39;)

That&#39;s it. Seems simple enough. Let me make sure there&#39;s no edge cases. What if one of the numbers is zero? Like a=0, b=5. Then 0*5=0. Which is handled correctly. What if a is 10 and b is 20? 0*0=0. Correct. Negative numbers: a=-3, b=-7. Unit digits are 3 and 7. Product is 21. Which is correct. So yes, this should work.

    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    return &#34;&#34;.join([chr((((ord(ch) - 5 - ord(&#34;a&#34;)) % 26) + ord(&#34;a&#34;))) for ch in s])

Testing this with some examples. Let&#39;s see:

If encode_shift(&#34;abc&#34;) would be &#34;fgh&#34;. DecodeShift(&#34;fgh&#34;) should return &#34;abc&#34;.

Another example: encode_shift(&#34;xyz&#34;) would be &#34;cde&#34; (x-&gt;c, y-&gt;d, z-&gt;e). Decoding &#34;cde&#34; would give xyz.

Another case: encode_shift(&#34;a&#34;) is &#39;f&#39;, decode_shift(&#39;f&#39;) is &#39;a&#39;.

What about if the character is &#39;a&#39; in the decoded string? Like, if the encoded string is &#39;f&#39;, decoding gives &#39;a&#39;.

Yes, that&#39;s correct.

So the code looks correct. The key difference from encode_shift is substituting +5 with -5 in the calculation. Also, ensuring that the modulus operation handles negative numbers correctly. In Python, the modulo operator handles negative numbers properly, so even if (ord(ch) -5 - ord(&#39;a&#39;)) is negative, the %26 will adjust it to the correct positive value.

Therefore, the implemented decode_shift function should work as required.
&lt;/think&gt;

def decode_shift(s: str):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    return &#34;&#34;.join([chr((((ord(ch) - 5 - ord(&#34;a&#34;)) % 26) + ord(&#34;a&#34;))) for ch in s])</pre>

def pluck(arr):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    &#34;Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.
    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.

    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Example 1:
        Input: [4,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

    Example 2:
        Input: [1,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. 

    Example 3:
        Input: []
        Output: []
    
    Example 4:
        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]
        Output: [0, 1]
        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,
                     so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.

    Constraints:
        * 1 &lt;= nodes.length &lt;= 10000
        * 0 &lt;= node.value

Yes, that should do it. Testing with the samples.
